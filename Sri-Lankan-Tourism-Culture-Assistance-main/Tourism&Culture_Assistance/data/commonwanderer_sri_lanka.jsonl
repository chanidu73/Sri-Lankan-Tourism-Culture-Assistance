Sri Lanka is an island that everyone loves at some level inside themselves. A very special island that travellers, from Sinbad to Marco Polo, dreamed about. A place where the contours of the land itself forms a kind of sinewy poetry. - Romesh Gunesekera Welcome to Sri Lanka: Bite-Sized Utopia It was the scent of Sri Lanka we noticed first. Nose-tickling and exotic; the spicy curries and flavourful Kottu Roti, sweet burning incense and fruity tropical air. Then the other senses, bubbling together in a heady mix. The colours; deep ocean blues , lush tea greens . A silky pink Sari flashing past as we whizz along in a rainbow tuk tuk. The sounds; waves lapping , a thick jungle breeze, a Buddhist prayer, the clacking of train carriages and vendors spruiking their wares. The warmth; of long hot days, of welcoming smiles, a sweet milk tea. Five trips to Sri Lanka have firmly cemented this island nation on our best-loved travel list. Where else could you enjoy a surf lesson one day , and hike in tea plantations the next? Or explore ancient ruins in the morning and sit in the doorway of the world’s most scenic train ride in the afternoon? From Jaffna and the north , only just opening to tourism after a decades-long civil war, to the sunny shores of the south, with Ancient World Heritage sites and safari plains in between; Sri Lanka leaves us wanting more every. single. time.

It was our first overseas holiday together, a trip to Tanzania in 2014 (long before the idea for this little internet baby was even conceived) that sparked our love-affair with this wild and diverse continent. Between hikes up Kilimanjaro , safaris on the plains of the Serengeti, and lazy days on the beaches of Zanzibar, we experienced a country so richly diverse , friendly, and beautiful, we knew we had to come back. Since then, we've also enjoyed the world-class wines of South Africa , stood at the edge of Victoria Falls in Zambia, watched gorillas in the steaming jungles of Uganda, canoed through the reeds of the Okavango Delta in Botswana , left footprints on the ancient sands of Sossusvlei , and hung out the back of a beat-up pickup with 20 locals heading to a peaceful mountain plateau in Malawi . To say the rhythm and beauty of this continent has captured our hearts is to put it mildly. If you're looking for life-changing adventure beyond the tried and tested travel routes, this is your place. This is a continent where rhythm rules all. The sound of lions as they prowl the savannah, the thunder of Mosi Oa Tunya (Victoria Falls) , the soft plodding of elephant feet in the plains. The language and music of thousands of cultures coming together, the song ' Kilimanjaro, hakuna matata ' as you stumble into camp after a hard day's trekking. This is still a land of extremes; vibrant cosmopolitan cities exist alongside extreme poverty , unrivalled natural beauty gives way to arid, isolated deserts, and ancient traditions fight for a place alongside new technology. But there’s a cultural richness and beauty here that has to be experienced in order to be truly understood. Plus you haven't lived until you've seen an African sunrise; a great red ball of fire rousing the wilds of the Savannah. Africa Travel Guides.

Going to Southeast Asia for the first time and tasting that spectrum of flavours - that certainly changed my whole palate, the kind of foods I crave. A lot of the dishes I used to love became boring to me. - Anthony Bourdain There’s nowhere quite like Asia. The starting point of our year-long trip in 2015: Singapore , followed by months backpacking through the southeast. For 3 months, we ate our fill in Singapore's Hawker Halls , rediscovered our sense of zen in the land of a million elephants (and temples!): Laos . We did jungle hikes at a community-based ecotourism project in Cambodia , watched sunrise over ancient temples in Bagan, swam in Sri Lanka ’s tropical oceans, and devoured many tasty street food meals in Bangkok . And while we have long loved Asia for its vibrance and beauty, this time around we also fell in love with it as the home of our favourite country in the world: Nepal . Amongst the hiking trails , chaos of Kathmandu , and people of Nepal , we found our own slice of travel Nirvana — we even got engaged there in 2019! The world's largest continent in more ways than one: most populous, most culturally diverse, and home to the world's largest mountain ranges … Asia doesn't do anything by halves. Crossing from one side of the continent to the other, you'll discover ancient gilded temples , lush tropical paradise, soaring snow-capped mountains , the peace of monks in prayer, and the honking chaos of colourful neon cities. Then there are the flavours. The sizzle and clink of a Kothu Roti being prepared in Sri Lanka , the fragrance of a steaming Pad Thai from a local street food cart in Bangkok, the mouth-watering mix of spices in an Indian curry. It's vibrant, spiritual, and at times dizzying; a rare mix of adventure and spirituality that offers something for every traveller. Our latest Travel Guides from Asia.

I love a sunburnt country, a land of sweeping plains, Of ragged mountain ranges, of drought and flooding rains. I love her far horizons, I love her jewel-sea, Her beauty and her terror – The wide brown land for me! - Dorothea Mackellar Fall in love with the wide brown land. Though we've spent little time here in the last five years, this is the country that raised us on a healthy diet of glorious sunshine, playing outdoors, and Vegemite sandwiches. Though it’s terribly cliched, the longer we spend away, the luckier we feel to call this burnt land home. From the food and wine ( Melbourne coffee, we miss you dearly) and thriving sports and culture scenes right through to the breathtaking landscapes and beautiful weather, growing up here has basically spoiled us for life. No matter where our travels take us, Australia will always be home. Beaches. BBQs. Beer: Any backpacker will tell you that these are the things that sum up Aus perfectly, and while they do make up a great portion of life in the 'Lucky Country', there's so much more to it than an endless summer party. Let's start with the landscapes. Rugged and wild, from the scorching red deserts of the Outback to the picturesque turquoise coastlines , Australia is both extreme and stunningly beautiful. There are the ancient rock formations of Uluru and the Kimberleys, thick forests that stretch from Far North Queensland to Tasmania, the technicolour of aquatic reefs. The rich spiritual stories and culture of our Indigenous traditional owners, the world's oldest civilisation, grew from these lands too. Then, there are cosmopolitan cities with quirky laneways to explore, world-class food and wine scenes, epic road trip opportunities , and a laid-back, jovial culture that's totally infectious. If you're all about the best things in life - the great outdoors, great weather, epic landscapes, and a bloody good meal - this is the place for you. Prepare to fall in love with the wide brown land.

Cobblestones, cafes, culture - Europe really holds a special allure for these two Aussies. Can you blame us? For a start, Europe is about as far from our homeland as one can get, and what could be more iconic to an Aussie traveller than the sparkling Eiffel Tower , the romance of Venice , the white-washed rustic villages of the Med , or the soaring heights of the Alps ?! But the beauty of this continent is its diversity, and while everyone else is visiting the major tourism players, there are so many more delights to discover if you're willing to take a step off the well-beaten tourist trails . Like Bucharest, the grungy capital of Romania (touted to be the 'new Berlin') , or the rugged arctic tundras of Swedish Lapland . We've now called this part of the world home for nearly 4 years (first in London, and now Budapest ), and the magic of being able to jump on a short train ride to a place where we don't speak the language, can’t read anything on the menu and can lose ourselves in a maze of cobblestoned streets and thousand-year-old history definitely hasn't worn thin yet.

Why responsible & sustainable travel matters to us. We love travel. But we don’t love what it can do to our planet. Emissions. Over-tourism. Exploitation. Pollution. Tourism’s impact on the places and people of this planet is undeniable. When it empowers communities and builds awareness of our diverse environments it can be a force for good. But when it results in environmental degradation, pollution, or overconsumption, its destructive and exploitative. Over the last 5 years of travel, we’ve witnessed the impact of plastic pollution , extreme poverty and exploitation, and environmental destruction firsthand, in countries all over the world. Needless to say, it totally changed the way we approached our lives both at home and on the road. “ We firmly believe that our love for seeing the world needn’t destroy it in the process. If we plan to spend our days exploring this pale blue dot, the only way ‘right’ way to do so is to travel with the planet and its people in mind. ” More of us are travelling than ever before. But being able to travel, experience new cultures, and witness beautiful places is more than a great privilege; it also comes with great responsibility. Tourism accounts for nearly a tenth of all the world’s global greenhouse gas emissions , overtourism is an issue globally, and slowly but surely, our beaches and oceans are filling up with plastic pollution. It’s unavoidable that your next holiday will impact the planet in one of these ways. It’s your choice whether that impact will be positive or negative. Responsible travel is understanding that your actions have consequences on places you visit. It’s about being socially, environmentally, and culturally aware, and trying to leave a place better than you found it. The best part? Travelling responsibly is actually super easy (especially with our tips below!), and it guarantees that the beautiful communities and landscapes you enjoyed on your holiday will continue to thrive long after you’ve gone home.

{"url": "https://www.thecommonwanderer.com/about-us", "title": "About | The Common Wanderer", "publish_date": "", "text": "Welcome . To The Common Wanderer. We’re Mark & Mim. Welcome to our little corner of the internet, we’re so glad you’re here! We wanted to share our love of travel and adventure with the world, so in 2015 we chose to wander; swapping our lives for a life on the road and real human connections instead. Our great leap into the big wild began with a one-way ticket to Singapore with only the bags on our backs, our DSLR cameras and notebook in our hands, and the tantalising promise of adventure. Since then, we’ve explored over 30 countries together, hiked the Himalayas in Nepal , watched the sun rise over the temples of Bagan, run-down Namibian sand dunes , delved into history in Europe, swam in vast oceans, safaried the African savannah , and explored ancient Cambodian jungles . Follow our adventures around the world on Instagram. Miranda FOUNDER + WRITER Mim’s pretty nice, but don’t mess with her before her morning coffee! She’s a photographer and writer of words; her happy place is on the road, finding new adventures and stories to share. Travel’s been one of her main squeezes since spending 5 weeks in China at 14… Since then she’s been back to China twice, visited over 30 countries, and wants to see them ALL! Her main hobbies are: eating, annoying Mark with a million hypothetical ‘what if’ questions (especially when he’s jet-laggged), and going on adventures in this big wide world. Mark FOUNDER + PHOTO + VIDEO Bortsa to his mates, Mark’s a Weet-Bix-fueled explorer. With a German granddad, Tanzanian grandmother, Namibian mum, and English dad, travel is literally in his blood. He’s the unadventurous half of TCW and pretty boring; despises photography, thinks “nature is lame” and refuses to do fun things like hike Kilimanjaro, the Annapurna Circuit, and Everest Base Camp. He’s also extremely sarcastic and loves to joke. In all seriousness, he’s all about exploring, documenting his love of adventure with his camera… and dodging Mim’s endless ‘what if’ questions! We believe in sustainability and the power of travel as a force for good. The Common Wanderer story. At first glance, you might assume we’re part of the ‘we quit our jobs to travel’ crew — except that isn’t quite true. See back in 2015 when this adventure started, we didn’t quit our jobs in marketing and communications just to travel. We quit them to create a business within the travel space that we were passionate about, that would help curious and adventurous folk like you (and us!) to experience more of what the world has to offer. Eight years on, and The Common Wanderer has become an award-winning travel blog and resource for those seeking authentic, real-life experiences and connections in exciting destinations all around the world. Here, we share the incredible, humbling, exciting places and human stories we discover during our travels, and provide you with all the advice and inspiration you need to depart on your own adventure, consciously, responsibly and ethically. Whether it’s thought-provoking travel stories, sustainable travel guides, or beautiful photography you seek, we promise to stoke your wanderlust and empower you to wander in whichever direction you choose. Want to work with The Common Wanderer? When it comes to the partnerships we take on here at TCW HQ, we’re all about working with purpose-driven brands and organisations that put people and planet at the heart of everything they do through sustainable, ethical, empowering practices and production.

UPDATED AUGUST 2025 Sri Lanka isn’t just another stop on the South Asia trail; it’s the kind of place that gets under your skin. One minute you’re sipping sweet, milky tea in the hills of Ella, watching clouds roll over the valley. The next, you’re barefoot on a southern beach, salt on your skin, the smell of curry leaves hanging in the air, and a tuk tuk engine humming somewhere in the distance. This tiny island punches well above its weight. Surf breaks and sleepy beach towns fringe the south, ancient ruins and sacred rock fortresses rise from the central plains, and jungle-clad hills roll out into one of the most scenic train rides on earth. Up north, Jaffna brings colour, culture, and a completely different rhythm, while in the east, elephants roam and the sun rises over untouched sands. It’s a country layered in stories - ancient, colonial, modern - and the only real challenge is knowing where to begin. That’s where this three-week Sri Lanka itinerary comes in. After months of travelling the island across five trips - sometimes fast, sometimes slow - we’ve pulled together our ideal route. A mix of our favourite places, a few lesser-known gems, and all the best bits in between. From the surf and sunshine of Hiriketiya and Ahangama , to the misty highlands of Ella , the ancient cities of Sigiriya and Polonnaruwa , and the colourful Hindu temples and swaying palms of Jaffna and the north. Whether you’re into sunrise hikes or late-night rotis, misty train rides or mornings spent floating in turquoise water, this route is your blueprint to discovering the best of Sri Lanka.

Edit like us with our Tropical Dreams Preset Packs , and Tropical Bliss mobile video filters, inspired by the tropical beauty and colour of this beautiful country SRI LANKA ITINERARY HIGHLIGHTS #1 The cultural highlights of Colombo #2 Beauty and history at Galle Fort #3 The endless golden beaches of the Southern Coast #4 Leopard spotting in Yala National Park #5 Verdant highlands and epic train rides #6 Rich history in Sigiriya & Polonnaruwa #7 History, culture and delicious food in Jaffna OUR DAY-BY-DAY 3-WEEK SRI LANKA ITINERARY DAY 1 | ARRIVE AND EXPLORE SRI LANKA’S CAPITAL CITY, COLOMBO The first point of call on your Sri Lanka itinerary is the capital, Colombo, where the international airport is located (well, technically it’s located in Negombo, an hour from Colombo). Honestly, Colombo is a hard city to love; it’s big, chaotic and has little in the way of must-see attractions. We’ve spent a lot of time there on two different trips, exploring the best things to do in Colombo , desperately trying to dispel the notion that travellers should skip over it and move on to better things elsewhere. A mission that ended up altogether unsuccessful. That said, the capital is still worth maybe a day of your trip, if not to see the crowded bazaars of Pettah, then just to experience the kamikaze-style driving of the city’s famed tuk-tuks. A few other sightseeing tips are: PETTAH MARKETS | in one of the oldest parts of Colombo, these markets are the best place to get initiated with the hustle and bustle of local life in the city. Selling everything from fresh produce to clothing, the chaos is intoxicating if not a little draining. Make sure you eat from one of the street food vendors! JAMI UL-ALFAR MASJID (RED MOSQUE) | Located in Pettah (meaning ‘outside the fort’), this is a must-see in Colombo. Built in 1908, the mosque’s tall minarets and domes can be seen from quite a distance and its mesmerising colour patterns and architecture are enough to take your breath away. It's possible for both men and women to enter, but you need to cover your arms, legs and hair. NATIONAL MUSEUM | A good place to get an understanding of Sri Lanka’s rich and diverse history, from ancient kingdoms to colonial times. We’d recommend going earlier in the day, although you only need to allocate a couple of hours. GALLE FACE GREEN | Do as the locals do, and head to Galle Face Green for sunset. This is an ocean-side urban park, stretching along the coast in the heart of Colombo. Pack with vendors selling everything from cooked crabs to sliced mango and chilli (a popular Sri Lankan street food!), it’s a great place to grab an afternoon ice cream and watch the locals indulge in their favourite pastimes. FOOD TIP | When you hear the noise and rhythm of metal on metal, stop! It means one thing: Sri Lanka’s famous street food, kottu roti. A delicious mash-up of roti, onions, leek, cabbage, eggs and sometimes chicken, mutton, beef, or our fave, cheese, Kottu roti is basically the best food ever. Chefs use two metal spatulas to mix and cut the ingredients on the grill with a rhythm, hence the noise. COLOMBO | THE DETAILS Where to stay in Colombo | Cinnamon Grand Hotel , Galle Face Hotel , or Vibe Hostel How to get around Colombo | Colombo isn’t easy to get around; however, trusty tuk-tuks are your best bet. Always use the ‘Pick Me’ app to book a tuk-tuk, or hire a tuk-tuk off the street (but always ask for the driver to put the meter on - this is a common travel mistake) The Ultimate Sri Lanka Bucket List: 31 incredible things to see and do DAY 2 - 3 | HEAD SOUTH TO STUNNING GALLE FORT From Colombo Fort train station, catch an early morning train along the picturesque Sri Lankan coastline towards Galle (around 2-3 hours). It’s one of Sri Lanka’s many beautiful train rides, so make sure you get the window seat to take it all in. Galle Fort is one of the unmissable places to see in Sri Lanka (learn all about Galle Fort with our guide ). Narrow, bustling laneways and crumbling colonial relics, an ever-present scent of exotic spices and the incredible tropical setting; there’s just something about this UNESCO World Heritage site that charms and captivates. MORNING | Explore the Galle Fort walls and ramparts, starting at the historic Clock Tower, before moving onto the Main Gate. There’s a heap of historic buildings to see within the Fort, including the Dutch Reform Church and the restored Old Dutch Hospital. Finish at the famous Galle Fort Lighthouse. Alternatively, head outside the Galle Fort to the local fruit, spice and flower markets to embrace some authentic Sri Lankan culture. DAY | Escape the incessant heat and shop in some of the local boutiques, art galleries, and spice and gem stores, or pick yourself up a retro Ceylon poster from Stick No Bills (our favourite shop in Galle Fort). AFTERNOON | Join the locals and tourists alike and head to the fort walls to watch the sunset over the Indian Ocean (Triton Bastion or Galle Lighthouse are your best bet). We’ve now visited Galle twice on two separate trips, and watching a sunset from the Fort walls remains one of our favourite things to do in Galle. NIGHT | There are a myriad of great restaurants to choose from, from local rice and curry haunts to upmarket fine dining. We loved A Minute by Tuk Tuk at the Old Dutch Hospital, where they served delicious contemporary Sri Lankan food. Try 'Batu Moju', an eggplant moju with roti and curry dips, washed down with the local brew, Lion Beer. While the Fort is rapidly gentrifying, it really is one of the best places to visit, and a must on any Sri Lanka itinerary. GALLE FORT | THE DETAILS Where to stay in Galle Fort | Galle Fort Hotel , Taru Villas , or The Fort Bazaar . Read our guide to the best Galle Hotels How to get from Colombo Fort to Galle Fort | Train. It’s a scenic 2.5-3.5 hour train ride from Colombo Fort to Galle. Trains depart 10 times a day (check out our Galle Fort guide for all the details) How to get around Galle Fort | By foot. Alternatively, tuk-tuks are a cheap alternative READ | Our comprehensive Galle Fort guide , where to stay in Galle Fort The best things to do in Galle Fort, Sri Lanka’s historic seaside fortress DAYS 4-5 | AHANGAMA & SURROUNDS Just a short bus, tuk-tuk, or taxi ride south of Galle Fort is Sri Lanka’s up & coming hotspot, Ahangama. Wedged between the ever-popular beach hubs of Unawatuna and Weligama, with easy access from the capital of Colombo and a main drag buzzing with a steady stream of tuk-tuks, roaring buses and noisy daily life, it’s neither sleepy nor tucked away down an adventurous jungle path MORNING | If you’re a surfer, head to the local breaks pre-sunrise for the best waves. If you’re not, enjoy a slow morning before visiting one of the myriad brunch offerings available. The Kip is our pick of the bunch. It serves an all-day, locally sourced, and earth-friendly brunch. The coffee is exceptional, maybe the best on the island. DAY | The golden sands of Kabalana Beach are the perfect place to spend a few hours. Flanked by towering palms and nondescript beach bars offering delicious kottu and tasty juices, the beach is great for swimming, surfing, or simply lying on a sunbed and relaxing. If you are more intrepid, visit Handunugoda Tea Estate (Herman Teas). Located in the hills nearby, the 60-year-old estate is renowned for its production of Virgin White Tea, and a tour ($2.50p.p) provides a chance to learn, understand and sample Sri Lanka’s most famous export along the southern coastline. Or, you could simply shop at some of the surf shops to slow-living boutiques in town. NIGHT | Sunset is when Ahangama comes alive. Ahangama Beach is filled with sunset bars offering exceptional cocktails, delicious small bites, excellent tunes, and some of the best vibes on the Island. A ‘roti shop with a secret,’ Hotel de Uncles is the pick of the bunch, serving local cocktails and exceptional rice & curry. Alternatively, we’ve spent many an afternoon at Ceylon Sliders, which serves excellent cocktails, even better food, and brilliant views of sunset. In the evening, local DJs play disco and funk, and the decking comes alive with beautiful people enjoying the end of the day. Finally, while we’ve not got involved in the after-dark scene in Ahangama (kids…), we hear very good things. Trax serves delicious cocktails and is open till late with local and international DJs ( @trax_ahangama ). AHANGAMA | THE DETAILS Where to stay in Ahangama | Read our detailed Ahangama hotel guide here How to get from Galle to Ahangama | For affordability, catch a local bus or tuk-tuk from Galle to Ahangama. Or, if you have ample baggage, Uber & Pick Me also serve the route How to get around Ahangama| As the area of Ahangama is quite spread out, we suggest a tuk-tuk READ | All the best things to do in Ahangama , Where to stay in Ahangama Parties and Paradise: the best things to do in Ahangama DAYS 6 - 7 | STAY AT THE STUNNING TRI LANKA (OR SURF IN WELIGAMA) The best thing about Sri Lanka being so small is that the distances required to travel between destinations are small and easy to manage, particularly on the southern coast. From Unawatuna, we recommend splashing out and spending a few nights at one of the island’s most beautiful resorts, Tri Lanka . A five-star, sustainable, luxury retreat nestled into the jungle that surrounds Koggala Lake on Sri Lanka’s southern coast, Tri Lanka is truly one of the greatest accommodation experiences we’ve ever had. The entire hotel is designed to be in, and of the nature that surrounds it. It’s absolutely beautifully appointed, with attention to detail like nothing we’ve ever seen. Nurturing body, mind, and soul is at the core of Tri’s values, which means there are plenty of activities available, including yoga, cycle tours of the local village, boat trips out to Cinnamon Island, a beautiful organic spa and a glass-walled library and reading room, and as well as a stunning infinity pool too. Bliss! This is the ultimate splurge, but trust us, it’s worth it (read all about our time at Tri Hotel here ). TRI LANKA | THE DETAILS Where | Tri Lanka , Koggala Lake How to get from Unawatuna to Tri Lanka | Private transfer (LKR 3,500) or tuk tuk (LKR 500) to Tri Lanka from Unawatuna BOOK | Book Tri Lanka READ | Our review of Tri Lanka, Sri Lanka’s best eco-hotel Sustainable Luxury on the shores of Koggala: You need to stay at Tri Hotel Alternatively, if you’re on a backpacker budget (like us 99.9% of the time!), head instead to the super cool surfing town of Weligama . A short bus ride from Unawatuna , or a cheap tuk tuk ride, Weligama is built for surfers, with hundreds of surf schools located right on the beach - just turn up, speak to a tout and you’ll be learning your way around a board just a few minutes later. For beginner surfers like us (we know, we’re terrible Australians!), Weligama is a great place to learn, with warm waters, cheap boards and easy waves, the perfect combination to catch that first wave. A 1 - 1.5 hour lesson costs around LKR 2,500 per person, and will teach you the basics of surfing, including how to stand up, paddle for a wave, surfing etiquette, and safety. We went with Freedom Surf LK , and they were awesome. We recommend basing yourself at Ceylon Sliders , a boutique hotel/cafe/surf store celebrating surf culture in Sri Lanka. It’s the coolest place on the southern coast, where surfers and yogis come to enjoy the best of Sri Lanka in an environment that wouldn’t be out of place in Bali. WELIGAMA | THE DETAILS Where | Weligama, Sri Lanka Where to stay in Weligama | We recommend staying at Ceylon Sliders . Alternatively, search for Weligama accommodation here Cost | 2hr learnt to surf lessons cost around LKR 2,500pp How to get from Unawatuna to Weligama | The cheapest transport is via a local bus (LKR 100). Alternatively, hire a tuk-tuk (LKR 1,000) DAYS 8 - 9 | CHILL IN HIRIKETIYA, SRI LANKA’S RELAXED BEACH PARADISE After learning to surf in Weligama, the stunning beachside paradise of Hiriketiya is where you can take your skills to a whole new level. What was once a sleepy hidden gem on Sri Lanka’s south coast, Hiriketiya is fast becoming the ‘it’ place for bronzed surfers riding waves all day long, digital nomads and their acai bowls, and salty-haired wanderers chilling into a new level of zen. We suspect it feels a little like Bali did 30 years ago, and we’re secretly hoping it stays this way. MORNING | Start your day at Bahia or Duni’s Hoppers, which serves exceptional coffee, delicious breakfast tacos, and rosti eggs benedict, which is to die for. You’ll be in foodie heaven here (and enjoy a welcome respite from rice and curry!). DAY | Surfers can hire boards from the water’s edge for around LKR 250 ($1.50!), which is an absolute bargain. Be warned, though - the waves get very busy from mid-morning to sunset, so we'd suggest surfing just after sunrise. Also, please remember to use surfing etiquette and respect the locals and their waves. For the ultimate zen, join a yoga session (or two) set amongst the jungles of Hiriketiya at Salt House (where you can also stay - they have beautiful rooms!). Although Hiri is amazing and you'll never want to leave, we do suggest you set aside a day to check out some of the main sights around Hiriketiya, including Dondra Lighthouse and Wewrukannala Viharaya. Completed in 1890, Dondra lighthouse is Sri Lanka's tallest, and in our opinion, most impressive (although the Galle Fort lighthouse pushes it hard!). The stunning coastal setting, beautiful palms, and lack of tourists mean it'll be worth the effort to visit - trust us. Wewrukannala Viharaya temple draws visitors from all over the country to see the giant Buddha statue, which at 50m in height, is the tallest in Sri Lanka. However, the most unique (and frankly terrifying) part of the temple complex is the Buddhist Hall of Horrors, a long corridor illustrated with ghastly depictions of Buddhist hell. It’s worth a visit, just for this. EVENING | Smoke & Bitters is simply unbeatable. Merge the best sunsets with the best cocktails (and food), and add a palm-filled space and excellent staff, and you have probably the best night out in Sri Lanka. You must book in advance. Alternatively, Mond offer excellent food and cocktails, while Garlic Cafe is a good shout for local cuisine (their kottu rotti is the best we’ve had). HIRIKETIYA | THE DETAILS Where | Hiriketiya Beach Where to stay in Hiriketiya | Salt House , Dot’s Bay House , Jasper House (or search for Hiriketiya accommodation here ) How to get from Weligama to Hiriketiya | The cheapest and most effective transport is via a local bus. Alternatively, hire a tuk-tuk. The journey should take around 2.5 - 3 hours READ | Our ultimate guide to Hiriketiya where jungle meets the sea: a guide to hiriketiya, sri lanka’s dreamy coastal paradise DAY 10 | LEOPARD SPOTTING IN YALA NATIONAL PARK Hiriketiya is the kind of place you’ll never want to leave, except to travel to Yala National Park for safari and leopard spotting! Jump on the bus (or tuk-tuk) towards Tissamaharama (Tissa to the locals) for around three hours, before making your way to Kirinda where the majority of Yala National Park accommodation exists. The impressive Yala National Park straddles the southeastern coastline of Sri Lanka and is a must-see on any Sri Lanka itinerary. The 1268km² park is home to a rich array of dunes, forest, open plains and lush lagoons, which also attracts a huge diversity of wildlife; 44 mammal species (including elephants) and over 215 bird species, to be exact, and leopards, lots of leopards. MORNING | Book a safari (pick up at 5:30 am, park opens at 6:30 am) for the best chance to spot the rare and incredible animals of Sri Lanka. Although you’re not guaranteed to see a leopard, the chances here in Yala are much higher than elsewhere, so keep your eyes peeled. It’s worth noting that the safari routes can get very popular and crowded, especially during high season. To avoid this, we'd suggest visiting during the shoulder season or joining a safari tour group. You can book a safari through your accommodation, or when you arrive in Kirinda. There are several Jeeps that roam the streets looking for tourists, so enquire with one of these and negotiate a price you’re comfortable with. We negotiated LKR 5,000 for the jeep hire, guide and morning safari; however, this price does not include the park entry fees, which are LKR 3500 per person, nor a tip for your driver if you feel their service was worth it! DAY | After your morning safari, check out and start making your way towards Ella. Alternatively, a visit to Udawalwawe National Park is an option. YALA NATIONAL PARK | THE DETAILS Where | Yala National Park, Southeast Sri Lanka Where to stay in Yala National Park | Back of Beyond, Dune Camp Yala How to get from Hiriketiya to Yala National Park | Bus is the easiest and cheapest option. Head to Tissamaharama (LKR 150 - 300), then change and catch another local bus to Kirinda (LKR 35). The journey should take around 3 hours. Alternatively, a tuk-tuk should cost LKR 6,000 Cost | LKR 3,500 per person READ | Our detailed guide to Yala National Park trip planning essentials: everything you need to know before travelling to sri lanka DAYS 11-13 | EXPLORING THE HILL COUNTRY AND ELLA From Yala National Park, head north towards Sri Lanka’s hill country and the town of Ella . Take the bus from Tissa towards Wellawaya, before changing to the bus bound for Ella town. The trip should take around four hours, so if you’re after a quicker (yet slightly more expensive) journey, hire a taxi or tuk-tuk. Tucked away in the misty Sri Lankan high country, amongst idyllic green hills and gushing waterfalls lies Ella: one of this tear-shaped island's most appealing destinations. The centre of all things outdoors, there’s so much to see and do in Ella that you could easily spend a month here, however, three days will allow you to see the best of the town and its lush surrounds. MORNING | Ella Rock is one of Ella’s most popular attractions, and sunrise is th", "images":

Sri Lanka ’s latest bohemian surfers paradise, Ahangama is having a moment. Home to a burgeoning boutique hotel scene, incredible restaurants & cafes, world-class bars, contemporary boutiques and lifestyle stores, and stunning beaches, Ahangama is forging a reputation as the home of slow, barefoot stays. With this rise in popularity has come an influx of excellent accommodation options in town, catering for all types of travellers - from those who have seen the finest in barefoot luxury, to backpackers keen to get amongst the waves, on as little money as possible. This where-to-stay in Ahangama guide aims to break down the best areas to stay within Ahangama, from the sun-kissed coast to the lush inland jungles, and provide recommendations on the best hotels, hostels, villas, and family-friendly options (we’re a family now, so this feels much needed!). LOVE OUR PHOTOS? Edit like us with our Tropical Dreams Preset Packs , and Tropical Bliss mobile video filters, inspired by the tropical beauty and colour of this beautiful country AREA GUIDE + BEST HOTELS IN AHANGAMA BEST AREA | Kabalana Beach, or inland LUXURY HOTEL | Kurulu Bay MID-RANGE | Panta Rei Resort HOSTEL | Maria Bonita FAMILY-FRIENDLY | The Mugatiya THE BEST AREA TO STAY IN AHANGAMA KABALANA The large beach situated between Koggala and Ahangama, Kabalana is less developed than the town proper, however is home to some of the best surf breaks in the area, so a number of popular surf schools call this area home. Expect a steady stream of sun-soaked surfers with boards under their arms. While the main street is not as buzzing as Ahangama town, there are still a number of incredible places to eat and hang out, including TRAX, Citra, and Sisters. It’s around a 5 - 10 minute tuk-tuk ride from Ahangama town. BEST OPTIONS | Casa Tikiri , Panta Rei Resort , Maria Bonita AHANGAMA The heart of Ahangama has gone from a sleepy seaside village to a hipster hotspot in a matter of years. The main stretch of road is now lined with local eateries, boutiques, and a growing number of hip cafes (CACTUS, Crust), bars (Hotel de Uncles, Ceylon Sliders) and design hotels. It’s also home to the best vibes, and it’s here that you’ll likely spend every evening watching the sunset, cocktail in hand. The surrounding area is filled with renovated Art-Deco mansions, villas, bohemian hotels, and quaint homestays, and serves as an excellent base if you wish for easy access to vibes, surf breaks, and excellent accommodation. BEST OPTIONS | Harding Boutique Hotel , Solas Surf SION Just beyond Ahangama Town is Sion, a quiet, leafy area named after a famous surf break. Less developed than surrounding areas, its quieter beaches and fewer crowds provide a wonderfully relaxed atmosphere. Renovated Art-Deco mansions and villas dot the jungle, and it’s home to our favourite cafe in the whole of Ahangama, The Kip (which incidentally also has amazing property. BEST OPTIONS | Dreamsea Surf Camp , Makai Surf House INLAND If you’re looking for a quiet, secluded stay, we’d recommend looking inland, to the thick jungles, lush green paddy fields and cinnamon plantations that circle Ahangama. This is where most 5* resorts and boutique villas are located, and it’s an ideal base for those looking to explore the countryside or combine beach time with something more serene. BEST OPTIONS | Kurulu Bay , Black Honey PLAN | Read our guide to Ahangama WHERE TO STAY IN AHANGAMA | THE BEST LUXURY HOTELS KURULU BAY The sister of Galle Fort’s imperious Fort Printers, Kurulu Bay is our definition of barefoot luxury and is by far the most beautiful hotel in Ahangama. Tucked away from the hustle of the southern coast highway, positioned on the gorgeous shores of Koggala Lake, Kurulu Bay blends contemporary design with the unspoiled beauty of Sri Lanka ’s south coast. There are a variety of rooms, 12 in total, all taking inspiration from Sri Lanka’s greatest architect, Geoffrey Bawa - think polished concrete, bespoke furniture and soft linens, but with 5* luxury in almost every corner. The pick of the bunch is the Treehouse, which provides excellent views over the lake and verdant surrounds. The centrepoint of the property is the minimalist pool, surrounded by towering palms and jackfruit trees, and poolside terrace, where the excellent restaurant serves up a locally-inspired all-day menu. There’s also an onsite spa, a yoga shala, daily excursions to Koggala Lake and beyond, and complete and utter serenity to escape the hustle of day-to-day life. Balancing luxury, design and nature, Kurulu Bay is the perfect retreat for discerning travellers. THE DETAILS Price | $$$ Amenities | Pool, on-site restaurant, spa, yoga shala, daily excursions BOOK | Kurulu Bay TREBARTHA EAST - THE ROUNDHOUSE A relative newcomer to the fast-growing boutique hotel scene in Ahanagama, Trebartha East - The Roundhouse is one of the more unique, and impressive hotels in Sri Lanka. Set atop a 12-acre cinnamon plantation, this astonishing, design-led hotel features 4 villas that offer 360-degree views of the lush south coast jungle, rice paddies, and the Indian Ocean. The rooms resemble the most luxurious treehouse you could ever imagine - exposed beams, teak interiors and floor-to-ceiling windows, which blend harmoniously with custom-made furniture, handwoven rugs, and subtle art pieces. The infinity pool might just be the most beautiful in Sri Lanka, while the on-site restaurant is inspired by local flavours and with sustainability in mind - the curries here are to die for. With a focus on privacy and connection to the surrounding environment, Trebartha East is a once-in-a-lifetime stay. THE DETAILS Price | $$$ Amenities | Infinity pool, on-site restaurant BOOK | Trebartha East - The Roundhouse HARDING BOUTIQUE HOTEL We’re not going to lie - when we first drove past Harding Boutique Hotel we couldn’t help but feel it jarred with the otherwise low-rise development on Sri Lanka’s southern coast (although this is changing, rapidly). But as our stay at Ahangama wore on, we realised that the textured facade and subtle design elements actually lifted the surrounding area, and we began to appreciate the structure and its vertiginous presence. Housing six boutique suites, which are tropical modernist in style and execution, Harding gives visitors to Ahangama what they desire - a front-row position to the best breaks on the southern coast. Add in 5* luxury, a rooftop terrace in which to eat your morning egg hoppers and a private infinity pool, Harding Boutique Hotel is the perfect boutique stay for salt-haired surfers. THE DETAILS Price | $$$ Amenities | Rooftop terrace, private infinity pool, breakfast BOOK | Harding Boutique Hotel TRI LANKA BY AMAYA Tri Lanka is: a destination within a destination. Original owners, Rob Drummond and wife Lara Baumann Drummond bought the land in 2003 , with a vision to transform this former cinnamon plantation into Sri Lanka’s first truly contemporary sustainable luxury design hotel. Construction took two years, and the end result is the Tri of today: “a masterpiece of forward-thinking flair where mathematical marries artistic, and intelligence embraces emotion”. Proximity to nature is what underpins everything at Tri; from the construction of the resort & rooms to its food, the wellness sanctuary vibes to the activities on offer. The rooms are minimalist, which only enhances the ‘back to nature’ vibe of the place, and one of the largest, comfiest beds we’ve had the pleasure of laying our heads on. There are no screens here, but more than enough beauty in the view outside your balcony to keep you entertained! We also loved the little touches, like the glass bottle of drinking water, lemongrass solid hand soap bar, and the jar of snacks that were refilled each day. Spa treatments, Quantum Yoga sessions, and the tastiest of dining are just a few of Tri’s many, many perks - while the atmosphere is peaceful in a way that you feel like you’re walking through a constant meditation session. This is the kind of place that attracts certain types of travellers; those looking for digital detox and inspiration will find themselves rejuvenated. Couples seeking romance will discover a tranquil hideaway. Nature lovers will find the hotel’s wildlife-filled location awe-inspiring. No matter what brings you here, to begin with, there’s no doubt that this is an ultra-inspiring setting for the mind, body, and soul. THE DETAILS Price | $$$ Amenities | Infinity pool, on-site restaurant, games room, library, daily excursions REVIEW | Read our comprehensive review of Tri Lanka BOOK | Tri by Amaya UYANA BOUTIQUE HOTEL | ADULTS ONLY The elephant in the room is that Ayuna Boutique Hotel is for adults only. Which is great for adults. But for kids, not so much. Thankfully, Ahangama is filled with family-friendly hotels (more on them below), so the adults can have their boutique bliss. Uyana is set inland, on a large coconut grove just a short walk to Koggala Lake - which means quiet solitude is the name of the game here. Four large, light-filled rooms feature contemporary fittings, high-end amenities and access to the communal lounge area. As with most properties in Sri Lanka, the highlight is the large, infinity pool which floats towards the surrounding rice paddies. Breakfast is included, while an on-site restaurant serves food throughout the day. Close to surf breaks and cultural landmarks, Uyana is an idyllic base for exploring Ahangama beaches and cafe scene, or simply relaxing in sophisticated luxury. THE DETAILS Price | $$$ Amenities | Infinity pool, breakfast BOOK | Ayuna Boutique Hotel CASA TIKIRI | ADULTS ONLY One of the things we love about Sri Lanka is the colour and life that exists in the in-between moments, and in stark contrast to many of the tropical minimalist properties listed above, Casa Tikiri embraces colour. Each room is an explosion of Frida Kahlo tones, and colour forms the common thread that unites all the rooms of this unique boutique hotel. Materials, fabrics and furnishings used have been seamlessly integrated with each other, elevating Casa Tikiri beyond the aforementioned hotels. With five rooms and two suites in total, Casa Tikiri is small, intimate and perfect for those who like barefoot luxury with a twist. The onsite pool, Italian-inspired restaurant, and sprawling gardens add to the appeal. As does the proximity to our favourite beach in Ahangama - Kabalana. Interested? Just look for the pink gate (but definitely book in advance below!). THE DETAILS Price | $$$ Amenities | Pool, Italian-inspired restaurant, gardens BOOK | Casa Tikiri WHERE TO STAY IN AHANGAMA | THE BEST MID-RANGE HOTELS PANTA REI RESORT Set amongst the towering palms a short tuk-tuk ride from the golden sands of Kabalana Beach, Panta Rei Resort is the perfect boutique resort for those wanting a little luxury, without the hefty price tag. The resort features 12 bungalows with differing setups, inspired by the boho-minimalism of Bali or Mexico. The rooms are huge, and feature ample storage, perfect if you’re looking somewhere to spend more than a week. Additionally, there’s a family villa offering two large bedrooms - perfect if you’re like us and want contemporary luxury, with kids in tow. Then there’s the large, inviting central pool and leafy communal area, which features a restaurant and bar serving excellent food and cocktails. This is probably the most family-friendly resort on this list, so book away if you’re bringing the family to Sri Lanka. THE DETAILS Price | $$ Amenities | Pool, communal area, on-site restaurant, family-friendly BOOK | Panta Rei Resort SWALLOW VILLA | ADULTS ONLY Tucked away from the bustle of Ahangama’s main thoroughfare, Swallow Villa feels like you’re staying with old friends in their wonderfully curated Sri Lankan home (if they were our friends, we’d be super jealous!). The modest facade hides an oasis of calm and a number of inviting bohemian-style rooms framed by tropical greenery. With four-poster beds, an ensuite bathroom, detailed tiling, and Stick No Bills artwork on the walls, the rooms are warm, inviting and unpretentious. Breakfast is served on the verandah, a medley of fresh fruit, fragrant curries, and strong local coffee - the perfect prelude to a day exploring Ahangama’s laid-back surf scene or lounging on its nearby golden beaches. It’s not luxury, but that’s the point. Swallow French Guest House invites you to slow down, savour the moment, and embrace Ahangama’s unhurried pace. THE DETAILS Price | $$ Amenities | Breakfast BOOK | Swallow Villa BLACK HONEY Ahangama is having a moment, led by a wave of Sri Lankan and foreign creatives pushing the boundaries of what barefoot luxury is. Inspired by tropical hotspots Tulum and Canggu , Black Honey offers colourful yet minimalist rooms with everything you need for a chilled stay on the salty southern coast. Each studio has a private kitchenette, a balcony overlooking the surrounding jungle and rice fields, and access to the communal rooftop and pool. The boutique hotel also houses one of the cooler cafes in town, serving specialty coffee, brunch and lunch, best enjoyed by the pool or lounges. THE DETAILS Price | $$ Amenities | Communal rooftop, pool and excellent cafe BOOK | Black Honey SURF STATION HOTEL One of Ahangama’s OG hotels, Surf Station has seen it all, watching the town move from a sleepy surfing hotspot to a Shoreditch-inspired bohemian hotspot. So you’ll need to forgive it for feeling a little dated. The rooms are neat, tidy and serviceable, and the pool is not as luxe as similar hotels in the area, BUT, the hotel is right on the beach, and the views from each ocean-facing room to die for. You win some, you lose some. And that’s why we’ve included the hotel on our list - it’s affordable, does the job, but is right in the heart of the action, especially for surfers. THE DETAILS Price | $$ Amenities | Pool, and beach access BOOK | Surf Station SOLAS SURF A surf & yoga retreat set right on Ahangama’s beautiful Kabalana Beach, Solas Surf is the perfect option for those looking to embrace the slow, laidback, tropical flow of Sri Lanka’s southern coast . With just a handful of rooms, Solas manages to strike an intimate balance between comfort and beachy bohemian charm, which we love. Each room opens to greenery, with large windows letting in heaps of natural light, while the decor mimics the chic simplicity of Ahangama. There’s a communal vibe at the heart of everything at Solas, including a pool, garden area overlooking Kabalana Beach, communal spaces, restaurant, and group activities, including surf classes and yoga. But the highlight is the surf-centric ethos. With lessons on offer and access to some of the region's finest swells, it caters to all skill levels. THE DETAILS Price | $$ Amenities | Pool, direct access to Kabalana, restaurant, and group activities BOOK | Solas Surf DREAMSEA SURFCAMP Days at Dreamsea Surf Camp revolve around the rhythm of the ocean. One of the OG surf camp providers, the Ahangama offshoot is everything you’d expect - affordable barefoot luxury with an adventurous surf lifestyle. The elevated bohemian-style rooms are simple, stylish and perfect for a laidback surf sabbatical. With a mix of private and shared accommodation, each room overlooks the Indian Ocean, and the delightful sunken pool, which will become your hangout during your stay. What’s more, the hotel has direct access to Ahangama Beach and our favourite bars/restaurants including Cactus, Ceylon Sliders and Hotel de Uncles. But it’s all about the surf here, and expert-led surf lessons cater to beginners and seasoned surfers, and provide insider intel on the best breaks on the southern coast. Additionally, there are rooftop yoga sessions to stretch out pre/post-surf. One of the more popular stays in Ahangama, we suggest booking Dreamsea well in advance. THE DETAILS Price | $$ Amenities | On-site restaurant, pool, beach access, yoga sessions BOOK | Dreamsea Surf Camp WHERE TO STAY IN AHANGAMA | THE BEST BUDGET HOTELS + HOSTELS MARIA BONITA A hidden gem in Ahangama, Maria Bonita shows that despite the town’s burgeoning popularity, it is possible to find an affordable, quaint hotel that feels like a home away from home. Located perfectly in between Kabalana Beach and Ahangama town, the rooms are beautifully decorated, blending tropical charm with a bohemian vibe. While there isn’t a pool, two of the better beaches are just a short tuk-tuk ride away. In addition to the vibes, surfers will love the proximity to famous local breaks such as “Gasstation” and “Cove,” just a short paddle away. Christina, the warm and attentive owner, along with her exceptional team, goes above and beyond. From scooter rentals to arranging transport and serving divine banana bread and smoothie bowls, their hospitality is unmatched. THE DETAILS Price | $ BOOK | Maria Bonita MELLOW HOSTEL Mellow Hostel captures the essence of backpacker life on Sri Lanka’s southern coast - the vibes are chilled, the accommodation is no frills, and the surf is never too far away. Located opposite Kabalana Beach, the position couldn't be better for surfers. The vibe of Mellow’s is easygoing yet intentional. The rooms are clean with natural finishes providing just the right amount of comfort, while the communal spaces and open garden allow the perfect chillout place to chat with fellow travellers. There’s also an onsite café, which offers up a local twist on Turkish Mediterranean flavours, with the addition of delicious smoothies. While nothing spectacular, Mellow Hostel feels like a home away from home - simple and welcoming. THE DETAILS Price | $ Amenities | Communal spaces, on-site restaurant BOOK | Mellow Hostel MAKAI SURF HOUSE Makai Surf House might just be the best affordable stay in Ahangama. Located in the quiet, leafy streets beyond Ahangama town, Makai offers a mix of private and dorm rooms, all of which are clean, spacious and well-appointed. The private deluxe and standard rooms are exceptional value - the rooms are huge, the beds comfy, and each comes with with private ensuite and natural finishes. There are big ‘home away from home’ vibes here - it’s welcoming and intimate, and the owners and staff make the stay here worthwhile. The green outdoor space has chill-out zones with hammocks and cozy seating, and there’s a communal dining table which often becomes the heart of your stay here. Some of our favourite beaches (secret beach) and cafes are nearby (The Kip), so if you’re after a relaxing, more sedate hostel experience, Makai is the perfect place. THE DETAILS Price | $ Amenities | Chill out zones, hammocks BOOK | Makai Surf House RASARA HOMESTAY During our first-ever visit to Sri Lanka, the majority of our accommodation was homestays, and we loved it. As the country has grown in popularity though, homestays have fallen away, with travellers seeking the more boutique, bohemian hotels along the coast. But, if you want a thoroughly authentic experience, we highly recommend Rasara Home Stay . Set in a lush garden, the property is an oasis of calm while remaining close to the beach and the Ahangama ‘scene’. The single studio is clean, spacious, and comfortable, and features a small kitchen ensuite. But what truly sets Rasara Home Stay apart is the hospitality of Bimba and her family.

From luxury hotels to family-run guesthouses, our guide to the best places to stay in the Kandy has your accommodation well and truly sorted. Kandy ; City of Kings, Sri Lanka’s second city and the island’s undisputed historical and cultural capital. A place that should hold prominence on any Sri Lankan itinerary , Kandy is best known for the Temple of the Tooth relic; Buddhism’s most important religious shrine, and said to be the location of a portion of Buddha’s tooth. But the city is so much more than its number one attraction; it's a city of delightful chaos, with its bustling streets, ancient temples, colonial architecture, aristocratic gardens and the glorious Kandy Lake forming the backdrop to a perfect few days amongst Sri Lanka 's lush green hills. As you’d expect from the cultural capital of Sri Lanka, accommodation for all budgets in Kandy is quite easy to come by, but knowing exactly where to stay will make a real difference in how you’ll experience it. Staying downtown will result in an authentic, albeit chaotic experience, while staying slightly out of town, in the lush hills or quiet northern suburbs, will provide peace and quiet. Ultimately, where you stay will depend on your needs, wants and budget, and below we’ve provided an overview of the best areas to stay, as well as the best accommodation options in town for all budget types.

As such, in the past we’ve found it hard to find the perfect area to stay, so after our recent third visit to the city, we wanted to provide an overview below to help in your own decision-making process. TL:DR - downtown is crazy but close to all the action, however, we’d choose a hotel in the beautiful Kandy Hills every.single.time. DOWNTOWN KANDY If you want to get the feel of the real Kandy, we suggest staying in the cacophonic downtown. We love downtown Kandy as it’s a great mix of colonial architecture, leafy streets and hidden corners, mixed with the chaotic commercial centre filled with colourful markets, old shops and restaurants serving seriously authentic (and spicy) local curries. It’s lively, gritty, and close to major attractions, including the Temple of the Tooth Relic, Kandy Lake and Kandyan Dance Halls, while the train and bus stations are nearby. That being said, it can be loud, and you’ll often find yourself seeking calm, so if you prefer a more serene accommodation experience, look to the hills. RECOMMENDATIONS | Heritage Boutique , The Radh, Kandy , Queen’s Hotel THE KANDY HILLS High above the city, the Kandy Hills are where you go to unplug and escape the noise of downtown. It’s quiet up here, and you can almost forget the chaos down below, so it’s understandable that most of Kandy’s best hotels are located in this area. With views across misty, forest-covered slopes, it’s the ideal spot if you want serenity close enough to the action. There’s accommodation for everyone up here - from five-star resorts to small, charming guesthouses. We recommend the hills to travellers who appreciate a good view, a cool breeze, and a short tuk-tuk into town when they want it. Just be warned - it’s often a tough walk uphill back to your accommodation, so use the affordable tuk-tuk’s in town. RECOMMENDATIONS | W15 Hanthana Estate , Helga’s Folly , 36 Bed & Breakfast KANDY LAKE The area around Kandy Lake is a sweet spot for travellers who want to be close to everything without the hustle. There are several exceptional and affordable homestays within the Lake surroundings, and staying here means you’re a short walk from the Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic, and many other of the city’s main attractions. Staying here means you’re close to the city’s historic core but can retreat to the lake's calm when the city pace gets too much, especially with a walk around the stunning Kandy Lake. RECOMMENDATIONS | Ru Boutique Hotel NORTHERN KANDY Further from the action, yet a wonderful area to stay in Kandy nonetheless, Northern Kandy and the banks of the Mahaweli River are home to many excellent, up-market resorts. Staying here is more about enjoying the daily rhythms of local life, away from the chaotic downtown and constant whirring of buses, however, it is further away from most of the action and can feel a little slow at times (what can we say, we love being in the heart of the action). RECOMMENDATIONS | Taru Villas Kandy , Mahaweli Reach WHERE TO STAY IN KANDY | THE BEST LUXURY HOTELS W15 HANTHANA ESTATE KANDY Sri Lanka’s cultural capital might be right on your doorstep, but the chaos of Kandy feels worlds away at the peaceful hilltop W15 Hanthana Estate . An elegant relic of the colonial era, this 9-bedroom plantation-style bungalow has been totally restyled in recent years, evoking a sense of timeless luxury for the discerning traveller today. After being greeted by your personal butler, spend your days relaxing in front of the panoramic vistas (the Estate looks over the rolling tea plantations and stunning Knuckles ranges of the Hanthana region) or enjoying the sun-drenched lawns, exploring Kandy’s main highlights, or reserve the vintage open-top Land Rover Defender for a true adventure to the Hanthana Hills viewpoints and conservation area. A truly pampered experience in one of Sri Lanka’s most fascinating regions!

The former home of late Sri Lankan aristocrat, Sir Cudah Ratwatte, the hotel is a chance to delve into Kandy’s rich cultural heritage; the six elegant rooms and suites are adorned with original artwork and unique antique Kandyan furniture and handicrafts, while the sightseeing delights of Sri Lanka’s cultural capital lie just beyond the hotel walls. On slow afternoons, enjoy the infinity pool overlooking Kandy and the surrounding hills, relax in the quiet of the library, or take a scenic drive around the lake in one of the hotel’s collections of vintage British cars before enjoying a sumptuous feast at the Elephant Stables onsite restaurant.

Everything at Santani is guided by the principles of harmony and balance, from the incredibly intelligent hotel design with sustainability and wellness at its core to its offerings of Ayurvedic and spa treatments, yoga and meditation classes or nearby hiking trails, and nutritionally balanced meals designed to nourish and comfort. This isn’t the place to stay if you’re looking to make the most of your time sightseeing in Kandy, but if you’re feeling weary and worn out from your travels through Sri Lanka, or overwhelmed by the stresses of the modern world, a few days spent stilling your mind at Santani is the remedy you’ve been seeking.

Set on a nine-acre spice and tea estate, Aarunya is about slowing down and enjoying nature’s lush embrace. Rise with the sun and birdsong, slow down by the infinity pool, indulge in high tea, hire a bike and explore the surrounds, or dive into the treatments and restorative yoga classes on offer. Aarunya is located between Kandy and Dambulla, about a 40-minute drive from Kandy train station.

With a history of over 160 years, this former governor’s home is now an 80-room hotel in the very heart of Kandy. Rooms and facilities are somewhat dated, however, the opportunity to experience an affordable slice of Sri Lankan history right amid all Kandy has to offer makes up for it.

From all your essential travel information to what to know before you go, the main things to see and do at Sigiriya Rock Fortress, plus responsible travel tips, accommodation recommendations and more, we’ve got you covered! UPDATED - July 2024 Rising from the lush jungle cover of Sri Lanka's central plains , Sigiriya Rock is truly a breathtaking sight to behold. This towering 200m sheer rock, thrust upwards from an otherwise flat landscape and often skirted by a veil of mist that shrouds it in mystery, is often referred to as the eighth wonder of the world. And a wonder it is, given that it’s both a geological marvel billions of years old and also home to an ancient palace and fortress built in the 5th century by a greedy King. Today, Lion Rock, as it's affectionately known, is steeped in human myth and legend about Kings and monks, triumphs and defeats, and the historical importance of Buddhism to the local area. For travellers seeking to understand the cultural heart of Sri Lanka , a visit to Sigiriya (and neighbouring Pidurangala ) is a must-do. Hiking to the top of the Sigiriya Rock Fortress to explore the ancient ruins and enjoy the vistas over the misty forests, lakes and villages below has become somewhat of a rite of passage for travellers to Sri Lanka, and something we think every visitor to the country should do. In this guide, we cover everything you need to know about visiting Sigiriya, including essential travel information, what to know before you go, what to see while you’re there, plus responsible travel tips , accommodation recommendations, and day trips from Sigiriya to nearby Sri Lankan highlights .

See, what happens when you’re the ambitious —but illegitimate — eldest son of the King, and your younger (but more legitimate) brother, Mogallana, is the rightful heir to the throne? You hatch a plan to kill your father by imprisoning him behind a wall and exile your brother to India before assuming the throne yourself, of course! King Kasyapa knew that this wasn't likely to be the end of the story though, and that his brother would eventually summon an army to reclaim what was rightfully his. In preparation, he moved the capital from the ancient (and flat) city of Anuradhapura, transforming the unlikely rock into an immense resting lion staircase, stately palace, and elegant gardens. The King’s Palace in the Clouds would only last 18 years though; eventually, his forces were defeated and Kashyapa died (by suicide or murder remains to be seen) in 495 AD . The fortress was eventually passed back to monks, while his legacy has millions of tourists flocking to its wonders each year SIGIRIYA ROCK ENTRANCE FEE & OPENING HOURS Entry to Sigiriya is USD $36 per person (as of 2024). The Sigiriya ticket office is located on a side street next to the main fortress entrance (location here ) and is open from 5:30 am - 5 pm (2024 opening hours). It’s easily missed, so make sure you visit this first to purchase your tickets before you make your way into the complex (don’t make the mistake of heading up the stairs without one, or you’ll need to turn around and retrace your steps again to get one!). Payment is possible in both cash and by card (this differs from our first visit in 2016 which was cash only), and while there is a Bank of Ceylon ATM next to the ticket office, don’t rely on it working (it wasn’t when we were there). Once you’ve purchased your ticket, head to the ticket scanning booth at the bridge over Sigiriya moat, before entering the complex. There are also public toilets located next to the entrance. IS THE SIGIRIYA TICKET PRICE WORTH IT? There’s plenty of debate amongst travellers as to whether the (admittedly very steep) entrance fee for Sigiriya is worth it. Obviously, it’s up to your budget and interests, but we visited on our first trip to Sri Lanka in 2016 and splurged on visiting the fortress with absolutely no regrets - it really is a super unique and interesting historic site akin to The Vatican in Rome, or Louvre in Paris - and no one has an issue paying an entrance fee there. The entry fee for Sigiriya also includes entry to the Sigiriya Museum, which explains the ancient city’s history and some of its top attractions. The fees for entry at Sigiriya (and other cultural sites around Sri Lanka) all go into the Central Cultural Fund , which funds the maintenance, research, and conservation of monuments and sites all over the country. While many people recommend heading to neighbouring — and much cheaper — Pidurangala (read our guide to Pidurangala here ) for epic Sigiriya views instead, what Pidurangala lacks is the ancient history, frescoes, and beautiful grounds of its more expensive neighbour. If exploring culture and history is something you love, we’d recommend making the visit to Sigiriya. THE BEST TIME OF YEAR TO VISIT SIGIRIYA, SRI LANKA Sigiriya is best visited during the dry season, between late December and early April , with March being the optimum in terms of visibility and weather conditions. That said, this is also very much the hottest part of the year; we visited Sigiriya in mid-April and let’s just say there isn’t really an adjective to describe how stiflingly hot and humid it was, even by 8 am! Pack as many fluids as you can, and sunscreen and a hat are necessities too. Do also keep in mind that as this is also peak tourist season, large crowds should be expected. We’ve even heard stories about the stairs becoming so jammed that the 1-hour climb became more like 2-3! THE BEST TIME OF DAY TO VISIT SIGIRIYA Sigiriya is open between 5:30 am - 6 - 6:30 pm each day (the ticket office closes at 5 pm - the exit time depends on many factors, but you’ll start to be ushered out at 6 pm). We visited Sigiriya in the early morning when we went, but these days we’d actually recommend going at sunset for a number of reasons: YOU’LL MISS SUNRISE ANYWAY | The gates open at 5:30 am, however, the Royal and Water Gardens are covered in shadow, so we head to enjoy, and there’s an hour's hike to the top, so sunrise is a no-deal anyway. You can, however, get some great sunset action by climbing later in the day. YOU CAN VISIT PIDURANGALA AT SUNRISE | While the views from Sigiriya are epic, you can't really beat the view from Pidurangala of Sigiriya and the Central Plains, best viewed at sunrise. Visiting Sigiriya at sunset and Pidurangala at sunrise is how we’d tackle the two ourselves! BEAT THE HEAT | Obviously, climbing to the top of Sigiriya in the late afternoon/evening means a good chance of avoiding much of the harsh heat of the day. Visiting at sunset also guarantees that you’ll enjoy some cooler weather on your descent, instead of the searing sun of the early morning hike. LESS CROWDS | Most people tend to visit Sigiriya in the morning through the afternoon; a sunset hike avoids these crowds. PHOTOGRAPHY | Sigiriya gives you 360° views of the Central Plains, so you’re not necessarily dictated by where the light’s coming from (particularly for those interested in photography) TIP | If you do decide to visit at sunset, make sure you purchase your tickets before 5pm and enter the park soon to avoid missing out. HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE TO CLIMB SIGIRIYA ROCK This really depends on your level of fitness and desire to explore every nook and cranny of the site. Those with a reasonable level of fitness who are also stopping to look at things along the way should be able to complete the 1000+ steps to the top in 60 minutes. However, do also factor in some decent extra time to wander along the gardens, explore the ruins at the top (we spent about 40 minutes up the top), and about 30 minutes for your descent. All in all, we’d recommend setting aside at least 3 hours for your visit. WHERE TO STAY IN SIGIRIYA HOTEL SIGIRIYA One of Sigiriya’s premiere hotels, Hotel Sigiriya offers five-star luxury overlooking the iconic Sigiriya Rock Fortress. The rooms are large, modern and comfortable, and the on-site restaurant is top-notch, however, the hotel’s key feature is the stunning pool overlooking the fortress. If you’re looking to splash out, you can’t go past Hotel Sigiriya. BOOK | Hotel Sigiriya LAKMINI LODGE Where we stayed during our 2023 trip to Sigiriya, Lakmini Lodge is minimal, modern, and affordable. Run by the most lovely local family, the hotel features spacious rooms, a wonderful breakfast, and a rooftop that offers exceptional views over Sigirya. It’s also well located, close to local restaurants, and within a short tuk-tuk ride to the Sigiriya entry. BOOK | Lakmini Lodge BACK OF BEYOND TREEHOUSE We stayed in a treehouse at Back of Beyond Pidurangala (check their website here ), a sustainable eco-lodge in the heart of the national park and only a two-minute walk from the beginning of the Pidurangala hike. We recommend staying here if you’re looking for a unique experience in the Sigiriya/Pidurangala area! BOOK | Back of Beyond Pidurangala HOSTEL Alternatively, for those on a strict budget, One Night Hostel is a good option. Located around 1km to Sigiriya, and 2km to Pidurangala, it’s a super central location. Standard 6-bed dorms (which are air-conditioned!) will cost around LKR 1,500 ($8 USD per night). BOOK | One Night Hostel Sigiriya The Ultimate guide to Pidurangala: The best view of Sigiriya in Sri Lanka THE BEST THINGS TO DO AT SIGIRIYA ROCK THE SIGIRIYA MUSEUM Entry to the Sigiriya Museum is included in your ticket price, and it’s worth a visit to gain some background context to Sigiriya and its long and varied history. The Museum includes a large 3-D model of Sigiriya Rock, explanations of ancient (and extremely valuable) trading routes with the rest of the world, and plenty of photos of the early excavations undertaken by British archaeologist HCP Bell (who excavated many of Sri Lanka’s cultural sites) in the late 19th century. Sigiriya Museum is a photography-free zone. THE ROYAL GARDENS While most people flock to Sigiriya for the Rock Fortress itself, the stunning former royal gardens that surround the area are also more than worth your time. The gardens are peaceful and lush, with picturesque terraced gardens, lovely water fountains and features, and several natural boulders scattered through. They’re also considered to be amongst the oldest landscaped urban gardens in the world and made use of highly advanced technology of the time. THE WATER GARDENS The water gardens are the first you pass through as you enter the Sigiriya complex; a symmetrical collection of pretty pools and water features, former bathing lagoons and island pavilions that are fed by a sophisticated network of underground ducts and hydraulics systems that were engineering marvels for the era. THE BOULDER GARDENS Where the Water Gardens have the classic beauty and symmetry you’d also expect to see at any former royal palace in Europe, the Boulder Gardens are far more in the line of the ‘Angkor Wat jungle temple’ style, with narrow winding paths that twist through and past a series of ancient natural boulders. These boulders once formed the foundations of the monastery the monks of Sigiriya called home centuries ago, and at one point in time their surfaces would have been adorned with Buddha relics and shrines. Today, you can still see plenty of evidence of ancient monastic life here along the walls, caves, and rock shelves. THE FRESCOES | SIGIRIYA DAMSELS Potentially one of Sigiriya’s most famous, and celebrated, attractions, the frescoes wall is home to the so-called ‘Sigiriya Damsels’; 21 beautiful, scantily clad women with rather ample bosoms offering fruit trays or flower petals painted right onto the rock face. The ladies are rumoured to be either apsaras (celestial nymphs), King Kasyapa’s concubines, or even the figure of Tara, an important figure in Tantric Buddhism . Protected from the elements by the overhanging rock, the images are still stunningly vibrant and fascinating to look at. Photography is banned here to protect the Damsels — flash photography is highly damaging, and unfortunately, previous tourists have ignored warnings not to use it, so no one gets nice things now — and we’ve heard plenty of stories of cameras being confiscated without return, so don’t risk it. THE MIRROR WALL Once thought to be so polished that the King could see his own reflection in the stone, the mirror wall is a lot less shiny these days. That doesn't mean it’s insignificant though — it’s covered with the scrawls of ancient graffiti by the visitors to Sigiriya over the the 1500 years, with poems, visitor impressions, and tributes etched all over it like a huge ancient guest book, dating from as far back as the 7th century. Note | Due to the historical significance of some of this graffiti, visitors are prohibited from scrawling their own tributes today. Please respect this by not drawing on the walls yourself (nor on any culturally significant structure around the world). LION PAW STAIRCASE These are the paws that give Sigiriya its Lion Rock nickname; two gigantic lion paws that guard a narrow staircase. Once upon a time, the 5th-century stairway would have led one up from these paws and into the gaping mouth of the lion. Ascending to the final summit through Lion’s mouth was meant to be a symbolic reminder to Buddhist devotees at the time that Buddha was Sakya-Sinha or Lion of the Sakya Clan, and his truth was as powerful as a Lion’s roar. The Lion’s head collapsed long ago, leaving only these paws and initial stairs behind, though you can still see the various construction grooves or pegs along the way! THE SIGIRIYA SUMMIT The final part of the Sigiriya summit, up the narrow metal staircase that seems to be precariously nailed into the rock face, can be a little anxiety-inducing for those with a fear of heights. However, once you step out into the open space of the fortress summit the views over the emerald canopy below are absolutely worth it. The ruins of King Kasyapa’s fortified palace are scattered about here, though they’ve been whittled down to mere foundations and aren’t overly impressive to wander around. What you’re really here for is the views, and with Pidurangala in the distance and lush jungle carpeting the plains below as far as the eye can see, it’s a breathtaking sight, and a just reward for hiking up more than 1,000 stairs. THINGS TO KNOW BEFORE VISITING SIGIRIYA YOU’LL NEED A REASONABLE LEVEL OF FITNESS The climb to the top of Sigiriya Rock Fortress is not for the faint hearted; it’s a pretty gruelling hour-long stair incline in pretty stifling heat and humidity, and we guarantee that even the fittest amongst you will find it a sweaty, somewhat breathless hike. At the risk of sounding like your mum, be prepared by knowing your limits, having lots of water and sunglasses, sunscreen, and hat ready. Those with a fear of heights may also find it a somewhat challenging hike - but it’s very safe and totally worth it, in our opinion. ACCESSIBILITY IS AN ISSUE The only way to the top of the Sigiriya is via a steep stair-climb of about an hour. In short, it’s unfortunately not very accessible. If you have issues with mobility or steep inclines, unfortunately this might be a spot you'll have to pass on. Fortunately, you could still definitely explore the grounds of the fortress, and there are still plenty of viewpoints to see the rock fortress from ground level. IT’S POSSIBLE TO VISIT WITH KIDS, BUT COME PREPARED Visiting Sigiriya with kids is possible, but comes with caution. Firstly, if your children are 3 or under, we suggest packing a child carrier or backpack for the stairs to the summit. Pack extra fluids, as you’ll need them. Children will need ample sunscreen applied, and sun protection is necessary as the sun is oppressive come 9 am. At the summit, there are no safety barriers so keep a close eye on your childrens movements, especially when explore the ponds in the southern corner of the summit. PAY ATTENTION TO PHOTOGRAPHY SIGNS Photography is actually banned in a few places along the Sigiriya hike, particularly along the frescoes wall. The signs are pretty hard to miss, and they’re there assist in the protection and preservation of the centuries-old rock paintings, so please don’t ignore them. Management is very strict on this rule now, and have been known to confiscate cameras (without return) if you ignore this. DON’T RIDE THE ELEPHANTS In a modern world, we shouldn’t need to tell you this, but don’t partake in any elephant rides. Rides are offered on the outskirts of the Sigiriya complex and we’ve seen many a foolish tourist take one. Don’t be one of them - it’s cruel, unethical and simply pathetic behaviour (read why here ). DON’T DISTURB THE SIGIRIYA WASPS! As you walk through the grounds of Sigiriya, you’ll notice warning signs about wasps in the area — these are not to be taken lightly! There are a number of large wasp nests throughout the grounds and in the rock walls, and there are, unfortunately, a few attacks each year. Supposedly, there’s a locally-held belief that they’re actually King Kashyapa’s reincarnated army back to guard his fortress. Whether you believe this or not, the best way to avoid getting stung is by walking very quietly and avoiding aggressive gestures, particularly along the stairs. There are also protective mesh cages visitors can use during a wasp attack. Don’t let this put you off though— we didn’t encounter any issues during our visit. THERE’S NO REAL DRESS CODE Unlike other cultural sites in Sri Lanka (including neighbouring Pidurangala), Sigiriya isn’t a sacred religious site or temple, so you won't need to cover up too much. That said, do remember that clothing in Sri Lanka tends to be more on the conservative side… and as per the above note on wasp attacks, you might want to wear longer clothing as a protective measure whilst here! HOW TO GET TO SIGIRIYA To save time and for ease of travel, we recommend travelling to Sigiriya from Dambulla, mid-way between Kandy and the ancient rock fortress (and also home to the famous Dambulla Rock Temples). We haven’t listed travel options from some Sri Lankan cities, like Jaffna , as it simply doesn’t make sense to attempt to travel from these in one go either due to travel times or it just being an unnecessary faff! For a full Sri Lanka itinerary including both Dambulla and Sigiriya, don’t forget to check out our 3-week route guide ! To plan and pre-book your Sri Lanka transport, click here . HOW TO GET FROM DAMBULLA TO SIGIRIYA From Dambulla, you have two transport options: BY BUS | At the Dambulla Main Bus Station, take the regular bus service to Sigiriya (they run every 30 minutes between 6:45 am - 6:00 pm). The journey will take about an hour, and tickets should set you back", "images":

To help you have the most incredible train adventure, this guide contains everything you need to know, from tickets and timetables to what to expect and photography tips. UPDATED - June 2024 I’m sitting in the open doorway of a rickety train as it makes its way from Kandy to Ella; feet dangling over the footboard as the wooden sleepers roll past. In front of me, Sri Lanka ’s lush hill country rolls out before us; a thick shag pile rug of green tea fields and misty mountains. Flecks of vivid colour dot the landscape, the brightly-coloured saris of pickers who keep the country’s famed tea industry alive. Behind, a group of young locals beat a drum and sing local songs with such infectious enthusiasm that before long, the entire carriage is swept up in a happy cacophony of laughter and dance. Somewhere along the train, a vendor is calling ‘wade wade,’ and my mouth waters at the thought of those deliciously crispy fried balls of dhal, best washed down with a sweet cup of warm chai. Trains pass in the opposite direction, locals precariously balanced on steps below signs that warn against the very same. A train conductor smiles and waves, his starched white uniform crisp and magnificent against the lumbering blue carriages. The breeze picks up strands of hair and they dance around my face. I close my eyes, breathe deeply, and smile. This is joy, pure and simple. … Sri Lanka ’s train ride from Kandy to Ella is easily one of the most iconic images of this bite-sized Utopia in the Indian Ocean. Having made the journey more than five times (the last being in 2023), we can attest to how incredible it is. But in the last few years, the train ride has become almost too popular for its own good. Knowing how and when to buy tickets, which station to board from, and how to get the most out of your experience is more important than ever. This is why we’ve put together this Kandy to Ella train guide with absolutely everything you need to know, from tickets to timetables and what to expect, to help you have the most incredible time on your own adventure.

The station is typically beautiful; they all are in this part of the world one of the few positive outcomes of British rule. Modernist on the exterior, Victorian on the interior and station platforms, it harks back to yesteryear, of simpler times when train travel was the way to get around, and air travel was still a pipe dream. It’s hot, humid, and busy. Locals accompany the station benches, with an endless bounty of bags stretched out in circles surrounding the seat. The train from Colombo arrives. It’s a loud, heaving Chinese-made diesel locomotive, coloured turquoise blue. Imagine this coloured train in your hometown - how out of place it’d look amongst the shades of grey concrete, steel and glass. Yet here, it just works. It’s beautiful, even. We alight to our third-class carriage - our already stretched backpacker budget allowing for little niceties. It’s busy, yet orderly. We miss getting seats, so we plonk ourselves and our bags into the service area. It’s uncomfortable, hot, and somewhat frustrating, but oh well, we’re going to Ella. The Kandy to Ella train has been running this route since the 1920s, a way of transporting tea to the ports of Colombo and the cups of the English. It wasn’t until the 1960s that passengers overtook freight as the primary revenue stream, and now, well, it’s popular. Really popular. The train jolts heavily, shifting our bodies from their slumped position, and before long we’re making our way out of Kandy, slowly, surely, winding our way through the jungle towards the hill country. The first hours are spent chatting with locals who have seemingly adopted us, keen to provide the best possible impression of their homeland. “Where are you from?”, asks one friendly man. “Australia”, I reply. “Oh, Shane Warne, Ricky Ponting, Glenn McGrath… but my favourite is Adam Gilchrist!”. Mid-2000s cricketers seem to be popular in this part of the world. “I love Gilly too”. Despite crawling along the tracks at a rather slow speed, there’s a real sense of freedom and adventure to be felt in these carriages; the wind whipping through doors and windows to tease your hair, groups of locals singing and dancing in carriages, dangling your feet out of the open doorway and watching the tracks blur by, platforms full of colourful saris and families waving goodbye to each other. Vendors balance flasks of sweet chai and steaming hot wade precariously as they race through carriages, and everyone, local and tourist alike, is positively beaming with excitement. Before long the warmth disappears, melting away to cool breeze. It’s glorious, as are the vistas we see from the open door. That open door is to be our seat for the next four hours. We bypass misty mountains, endless tea plantations, picturesque stations, colourful tuk-tuks, and bustling towns, each providing a glimpse into the everyday lives of thousands of people. It’s simply wonderful. In our opinion, this is one of the greatest train rides in the world - and definitely one of the best things you can do in Sri Lanka .

It’s simply a matter of showing up at the station a bit earlier and queueing at the ticket office. Unreserved tickets also can’t sell out - they’re uncapped. If you’re told that tickets have sold out, it’s probably because the seller has assumed that as a foreigner, you’d prefer a reserved seat. You can always buy an unreserved ticket. Neither second-class unreserved nor third-class tickets guarantee you a seat. Remember though, if you want to get a reserved seat in the first or second class, you must book in advance - you can’t buy reserved tickets on the day of travel. If you prefer winging your travels, we suggest getting to the station at least 2 hours prior to departure to purchase your tickets (but seriously, just buy them online and save yourself the hassle)! BEST FOR | Those who are travelling spontaneously through Sri Lanka, and don’t mind third class or unreserved seats RESERVED TICKETS Reserved seating cannot be purchased on your day of travel, so you must book reserved tickets ahead of time . In the off-season, you can probably get away with booking these at your departure station a few days ahead of time. Otherwise, book online (32 days before) at 12go Asia . We think purchasing your tickets in advance is the smartest thing to do, regardless of your travel plans in Sri Lanka. Not only will you secure your seat, but you’ll also have much greater peace of mind knowing you’ll be able to. BOOK | You can book online (32 days before) here BEST FOR | Well-prepared travellers who wish to secure tickets in advance HOW MUCH DO KANDY TO ELLA TRAIN TICKETS COST? Overall, train travel in Sri Lanka is extremely affordable, though there are some big differences in pricing depending on which class ticket you’re after. From Kandy to Ella (or Ella to Kandy), prices are as follows: Third class | LKR 300, LKR 440 to Colombo Fort Second class | LKR 600, LKR 900 to Colombo Fort First-class | LKR 3,000 (LKR 2,500 if booked in advance) BOOK | You can book online (32 days before) here NOTE | Prices as of January 2024.

BOOK YOUR KANDY TO ELLA TRAIN RIDE HERE Powered by 12Go Asia system HOW LONG IS THE TRAIN RIDE FROM KANDY TO ELLA? The Kandy to Ella train journey takes around 7 hours - assuming there are no delays or breakdowns on the route! This might sound like a long time, but it’s the perfect opportunity to slow down and watch the world go by. Before you know it, you’ll be arriving at your destination and dreaming of taking the train again in the reverse direction. WHICH TICKET CLASS SHOULD YOU BOOK FOR THE KANDY TO ELLA TRAIN? Reserved or unreserved? First class or third class? When it comes to buying tickets for your train ride in Sri Lanka , the different ticket options can initially be a little confusing. Personally, we strongly believe that this train ride is one of the rare times where the best experience is actually found in the lower ticket classes. First class is stuffy with windows and doors that won’t open and most other foreigners occupying the seats next to them. The second and third classes, on the other hand, are a truly authentic taste of what life is really like for locals on the Sri Lankan railway system. That being said, First Class is your best bet if you’d prefer to admire the views from the comfort of a pre-booked seat. Here’s a quick breakdown of what each class entails (keep reading for costs!): THIRD CLASS UNRESERVED Third Class Unreserved are the cheapest tickets available for the train, and as such, tend to be the most popular with locals too. The seating here is non-allocated wooden benches (it’s basically a free for all!) so be prepared that at least some of your journey will involve standing. For all that the journey may be a little uncomfortable though, this is where the most authentic taste of Sri Lankan life can be found though. Groups of local boys sing and play drums, big families crowd together on one or two benches, sharing meals and passing little ones across the carriage for the best views, while vendors squeeze past with precariously balanced trays of deep-fried delights. The mood is jovial and everyone’s keen to chat - it’s just a super happy place to be! THIRD CLASS RESERVED Exactly as above, but with the difference of allocated seating. It’s a little less chaotic, but the mood is just as fun. This is probably our favourite place to be on the Sri Lankan rail network, as it comes with all the fun and local interaction of third class, but with the slightly more organised aspect of having a (mostly) guaranteed seat. You can also open the windows and doors here, and the doorways don’t tend to be as crowded as you may find in the unreserved carriages - perfect for dangling your feet over and feeling the wind through your hair! SECOND CLASS UNRESERVED A little softer than third-class seating-wise, though in a stuffy carriage with hard seating, this doesn’t really make too much of an impact! Not too much more expensive than the third class, but again, you’ll probably need to push your way onto the train for this one. These seats tend to be great if you’re travelling in the off or shoulder seasons, as the trains are a lot less busy then. SECOND CLASS RESERVED As above, with allocated seating this time. The price jump for reserved seating in this carriage is about half again of what you’d pay for the other classes, but if you’re travelling during peak season and you know your travel dates in advance, it’s absolutely worth booking these well ahead of your arrival to Sri Lanka (read our top Sri Lanka travel tips for more handy tips). Note that these will often sell out 1-2 months in advance during peak season, so booking online is the best option. FIRST CLASS Allocated plush(ish) seating, privacy, and air conditioning are the main features here. We absolutely wouldn’t recommend this carriage if you’re wanting to get a real feel for the train ride though; the windows and doors remain locked, and you’ll be rubbing shoulders mostly with other foreigners. It’s not exactly the most authentic way to experience the country or the train, but if you’ve already taken a few train journeys and just want to get to your destination comfortably, this might be the option for you. OBSERVATION CARRIAGE These are only available on select trains and are mostly just 1st class carriages with the added feature of wide windows for observing the views. Observation carriages will need to be booked a month or more from your travel date and sell out extremely quickly, so you’ll need to organise them online (check 12go Asia ) before your trip. Again, we don’t actually recommend the observation carriage, as a) you can’t open the windows and b) the carriages are often at the end of the train, facing backwards. If travelling in the wrong direction makes you nauseated, definitely avoid this one! sri lanka’s most stunning sights | a guide to nine arch bridge, ella TIPS & FAQS FOR RIDING THE KANDY TO ELLA TRAIN ABOUT THE KANDY TO ELLA TRAIN RIDE As with many railways in this part of the world, the Sri Lankan rail network was initially conceived by the British colonial government in 1864. It was initially built to transport tea and coffee (the latter quickly failed after a mystery fungus wiped out entire crops) from the misty hill country to Colombo for export. For years, these tightly packed crates of tea were the primary passengers on this route, until population growth saw passenger traffic explode past it in the 1960s. Today, the network is one of the cheapest ways to navigate Sri Lanka and is a vital transport link for locals. WHEN IS THE BEST TIME TO RIDE THE KANDY TO ELLA TRAIN? We suggest travelling on the Kandy to Ella train during December-March, as this is Sri Lanka’s least wet time of year. At this time, the tea plantations are still wonderfully green, the waterfalls flowing, and the weather comfortable. It is, however, peak season, so expect large crowds (buy your tickets in advance to secure your seat). Personally, we’ve ridden the Kandy to Ella train in April and November, and while both were equally joyous - April was during Sinhalese New Year, which made securing a spot on the train virtually impossible. We also suggest taking the morning train, as this tends to be quieter and more peaceful, and you’re guaranteed to arrive at your destination (whether it’s Ella or Kandy) at a reasonable hour in the afternoon. CONSIDER STARTING YOUR JOURNEY AT PERADENIYA JUNCTION TO GET A SEAT Trying to get on the train at Kandy can be nigh on impossible for those wanting to ride in third class, especially at peak times. But fret not travellers, we have a sneaky tip for you that might even win you a seat! Rather than concertina yourself on board here, grab a tuk-tuk and head ten minutes away to Peradeniya Junction station , on the outskirts of Kandy. Board the reverse service (Badulla/Ella to Kandy/Colombo, or the incoming Colombo to Badulla train) here at Peradeniya, which is the last stop before its final arrival in Kandy. When everyone on this service finally disembarks from the train at Kandy station, you'll be primed to grab a seat (as you're already on board!) before the hordes of people embark again at Kandy for the service from here to Ella. If you’re travelling from Ella, the same trick applies - just take a tuk-tuk to Badulla station (the starting point of the return train journey), and embark Thank us later. 2024 UPDATE | This little trick of ours has been replicated by blogs and TikToks everywhere, so it’s not necessarily a secret anymore. Expect it to be busy, no matter what. THE JOURNEY CAN BE TAKEN IN REVERSE We’ve had a number of emails and comments on our Instagram recently regarding whether travellers will miss out on anything by taking the Kandy to Ella train in reverse (ie. travelling from Ella back to Kandy). The answer is: no! The train travels the exact same route back again, so you won’t miss out on any of the fun by taking it in reverse. We suggest taking a tuk-tuk to Badulla Station and starting your journey from there - you’ll cross the Nine Arch Bridge in the process, and have a far higher likelihood of getting a seat. SIT ON THE RIGHT-HAND SIDE OF THE KANDY TO ELLA TRAIN This is one of, if not the most important tips: if you’re coming from Kandy, sit on the right side of the train, unless you want to be gawking at an up-close view of the cliff side (you don’t). The right side is significantly more beautiful than the left, with views over the rolling tea plantations, misty mountains, and lush valleys. Obviously, this is flipped if you’re travelling from Ella back to Kandy; be sure to sit on the left then.", "images":

Discover famous attractions, historic sites, sunset viewpoints, and the best food with our comprehensive Galle Fort travel guide! UPDATED - July 2024 From the moment we first wandered into Galle Fort, we knew it was love. Narrow, bustling laneways, historic architecture, an ever-present scent of spice and the incredible tropical setting; there’s just something about this UNESCO World Heritage site that captivates. For centuries, this vital trading port connected Sri Lanka with spice merchants across Asia and beyond. From the 16th century, Portuguese, Dutch, and later British, colonial occupations all left their marks, including the extensive 17th-century Dutch fortifications that still stand today - many of the ramparts and Fort streets still carry signs of those overlapping histories. Today, the Galle Fort area is unlike any other place we’ve found in Sri Lanka ; an atmospheric town where culture, religion, and different architectural eras collide in the tropics. Popular with tourists, it’s still very much a living town both within and outside the fort walls (and we definitely do encourage you to explore the wider Galle town beyond the Fort!). Historic mosques and churches stand alongside boutique hotels and upscale restaurants, school bells ring in the afternoon as crisp white uniforms spill onto streets alongside tuk tuks and tourists, and of an evening, the ramparts are always abuzz with sunset-seekers (our own personal favourite pastime!), local vendors, and thrill-seeking cliff divers. It should be said that Galle Fort is rapidly gentrifying as chic boutiques, cafes, and heritage hotels begin to conserve and restore the whitewashed historic buildings - and prices have skyrocketed over the last few years as a result. Where possible, we recommend seeking out locally owned businesses (keep reading for our recommendations below) to ensure that the local community benefits from its rapid popularity too. Often the starting point of adventures along the southern coastline, Galle is definitely an unmissable stop on your Sri Lankan itinerary , and a great place to slow down and explore at leisure. We’d recommend staying at least two nights to get a good feel for it before moving onto the southern beaches - although however long you stay, you’ll find plenty to enjoy. LOVE OUR PHOTOS?

Beautiful Galle Fort is located in the city of Galle in the southwest corner of Sri Lanka, around 110km from the capital, Colombo, and just a short drive to some of Sri Lanka’s popular beachside enclaves, including Hikkaduwa, Unawatuna, and Mirissa. Situated on a rocky peninsula, the sea surrounds Galle Fort from three sides, making it a wonderful location for a Fort. THE HISTORY OF GALLE FORT To really understand Galle you’ve got to understand its history, for the mighty fortress, imposing churches and mosques, crumbling colonial-era villas, and blend of cultures make little sense otherwise. For centuries (if not millennia), Galle was a major trading hub for merchants all around the globe due to its strategic location for ancient shipping routes, and its safe, well-protected harbour. Part of the ancient Maritime Silk Road, Galle can be found Ptolemy’s world map of 125-150 AD as a port of trade for Greek, Arabic and Chinese traders. Boats laden with spices, metals, gems, silk, and porcelain destined for markets East and West passed by Sri Lanka’s southern coastline, itself abundant with spices, particularly cinnamon, pepper, cardamom and cloves, that became a vital export commodity for the Sinhalese kingdoms. It was through the port of Galle that most of these commodities were exported. Of course, foreign traders soon sought to control spice exports, and before long, the Moors (mostly of Arab descent) occupied the northern harbour creating an enclave distinct from the local Sinhalese community. Arab descendants still live within the Fort today, visible in the mosques, street signs and surnames. … In the 16th century, European colonisers arrived. The Portuguese, having already forged a direct access route to the Indian spice trade, had established naval dominance in the Indian Ocean, eventually annexing Galle in 1518 and taking control from the Moors. The first Galle Fort was built and constantly expanded to defend against rival powers vying for control of the lucrative spice trade. In 1640, the Dutch captured Galle following a fierce battle. Through the notorious Dutch East India company, the fort’s current layout was completed in 1663. Covering 52 hectares with walls over 3 kilometres long and fourteen bastions housing over 100 cannons. From that point on, despite the burgeoning wealth within, the fort was never attacked again. By the 1800s, advances in shipping had made Galle Fort almost obsolete: too small to houes larger ships, and too treacherous compared to newer, safer modern ports in Colombo. Galle fell into disrepair — but in a curious twist of fate, this actually saved many of its historic buildings from demolition. Today, its these buildings that house boutique hotels, hipster art stores, and a growing number of excellent restaurants and bars. Except for the devastation of the 2004 tsunami, which killed over 35,000 and caused widespread damage to parts of the city, Galle Fort has revived into one of Sri Lanka’s most beloved tourist destinations; a historic town shaped by a complex past. WHERE TO STAY IN GALLE FORT Galle Fort is teeming with accommodation options, from budget homestays to mid to high-end hotels, many of which are some of the most beautiful we’ve ever seen - think open, breezy rooms, private courtyards and exceptional service (it’s the Sri Lankan way!). Below are our favourite hotels to stay in Galle Fort, however, you can find a full overview of the best places to stay here . GALLE FORT HOTEL | A boutique hotel in a former Dutch mansion. Prices and availability here TARU VILLAS | A classically restored boutique hotel right in the heart of Galle Fort.

This beautiful white lighthouse dates back to 1848, (although the current structure was rebuilt in 1939), and stands on the walls of the ancient Galle Fort, guiding the safe passage of ships into Galle Harbour. The lighthouse is still very much in use, although it now has another, secondary role, as a prop to those wanting the perfect Sri Lankan photo . THE DETAILS What | Galle Lighthouse Where | Corner of Hospital and Rampart St Our perfect three-week Sri Lanka itinerary #2 WALK THE OUTER WALLS/RAMPARTS OF GALLE FORT If these coral-mixed walls and ramparts could talk, they’d have many stories to share about Galle Fort’s long and varied history. If you’re up for exploring each and every corner of Galle Fort’s outer walls, you can follow the ‘Fort Walk’, starting at the historic Clock Tower, before moving onto the Main Gate, heading south into the interior of the Fort, passing the Dutch Reform Church until you reach the western section’s restored Dutch Hospital. From there, continue south towards the famous Galle Lighthouse, before following the walls to Meeran Mosque , Flag Rock and Triton Bastion . The walk finishes at Star Bastion , overlooking the northern coast towards Hikkaduwa. Along the way, spot locals playing cricket, eat one of the many tasty street food options (wade, a fried lentil snack is our fave!), and cool off in one of the many inner fort bars. The walk is around 2kms and best done early in the morning or late in the afternoon, when the temperatures are more manageable - the sun in Galle is infamously fierce! Top things to do in Jaffna, Sri Lanka #3 WANDER THROUGH THE GALLE FORT INTERIOR Without doubt, one of our favourite things to do in Galle Fort is always to simply get wonderfully lost inside the fort, soaking up the UNESCO-protected streets, weathered historic buildings and colonial architecture, colourful boutiques and quiet courtyards, all framed by tropical greenery. For those with a little extra time up their sleeves, it’s worth turning off the main streets and exploring some of the quieter alleys, where intricate design, daily life, and a little more authenticity can be found. Thankfully, due to the high ramparts of the Fort wall, much of this area survived the, which means that there are plenty of beautiful architectural remnants Protected by the high ramparts, much of this historic heart survived the 2004 Boxing Day Tsunami , preserving its unique blend of architecture and history. Some sights and attractions we suggest you visit are: Dutch Reform Church | Historic Dutch church dating back to 1640 Old Dutch Hospital | Colonnaded former hospital dating back to the 18th century Amangalla | Former home of the Dutch Governor, built in 1684. Now a luxurious hotel, which does delicious afternoon tea All Saints Anglican Church | Built in the late 1800s from solid rock Meeran Mosque | The centre of the local Muslim community, built in 1904 Sudharmalaya Temple | Beautiful white Buddhist temple within Galle Fort A guide to Sri Lanka’s palace in the clouds, Sigiriya #4 WATCH SUNSET FROM GALLE FORT WALL Each afternoon at around 5:30 pm, locals and tourists alike gather along the fort walls to watch the sunset over the Indian Ocean. It’s a festive and happy affair; cricket games are played on the grass below, whole families gather to see off the last of the day, and travellers mingle and chat while Mother Nature streaks the sky all kinds of shades of blue, orange, pink and purple. We’ve now visited Galle twice on two separate trips, and watching a sunset from Galle Fort remains one of our favourite experiences in Sri Lanka . There’s just something about the glorious technicolour end to the day that feels a little more special here than anywhere else we’ve visited. We think the best point to watch the sunset from is the Triton Bastion, however, you can watch the sunset from pretty much any point on the western side of the Fort walls. Don’t forget to keep a lookout for the cliff jumpers at Flag Rock too; each evening a group of locals defy danger by leaping backwards off the ramparts to the ocean below. THE DETAILS What | Triton Bastion Where | Rampart St, opposite Pilgrims Bar Our guide to Hiriketiya, Sri lanka’s best-kept beach secret #5 GRAB A WORLD-CLASS COCKTAIL AT CHARLIE’S Between Rampart & Lighthouse Street, looking over the iconic ramparts that circle the Fort, you’ll find an art-deco masterpiece that’s been revived and restored into one of Galle’s best cocktail bars: Charlie’s Bar & Bistro. This popular rooftop bar is the ultimate sunset hangout spot, set against the backdrop of swaying palms, silhouetted against the marmalade hues of the Indian Ocean. The cocktails are excellent, incorporating flavours from the Spice Trade to provide a Sri Lankan twist to the classics. We spent a lazy afternoon here, sipping cocktails while watching the sunset, while reflecting on how different this experience was from our first visit to the Fort eight years ago, on backpacker budgets that prevented us from delving too far into the culinary and cocktail scene at that time. We recommend the pomegranate sour, a delightful mix of gin, basil, lime, passionfruit and pomegranate - the perfect cocktail for the steamy Sri Lankan heat. The Wadamala Collins, a lime-infused vodka cocktail made with garden-foraged hibiscus and curry leaf, also comes highly recommended. Unfortunately, we only got to sample the chippies (that’s toddler life for you), but from what we saw we’d have loved to spend the whole evening here, devouring the small plates. We’ve also visited Church Street Social (find it here ), another famed cocktail bar in the heart of the Fort. Set amongst a historic 17th-century merchant’s house, the cocktail bar is high-end, catering to Galle’s slightly older clientele. Our experience there was okay - the cocktail was quite weak, and the overall vibe was not quite up our alley. That said, it’s still an excellent option for an evening G & T in the town centre. #6 SHOP TILL YOU DROP ON PEDLAR ST, GALLE FORT Love shopping? Galle Fort is your place! There are literally hundreds of boutiques, art galleries, spice and gem stores, and handicrafts dotted throughout Galle Fort, with Pedlar St being the epicentre of the action. We definitely think the best shopping in Sri Lanka is within the walls of Galle Fort, so if you're looking for a bargain, this is your place. Mim was like a kid in a candy shop, visiting each and every store in search of handicrafts and textiles. Fortunately, Galle’s hub for shopaholics didn’t disappoint, and she walked away with the perfect linen dress for Sri Lanka's hot and humid weather. Some stores we suggest you visit are: Stick No Bills | Sells incredible 'Ceylon' retro prints, of which two now take pride of place in our home Exotic Roots | Perhaps the coolest store in the Fort, Exotic Roots is a mother/daughter-run boutique, selling handicrafts and artwork made by the owners Aida Gems | Operating since 1975, Aida is the only store to consider when buying gems or jewellery in Galle Fort Barefoot | an upmarket souvenir store stocking handwoven Sri Lankan sarongs and linens, unique jewellery, and one-of-a-kind souvenirs PR | A Concept store hailing also from Colombo stocking that stocks emerging Sri Lankan designers, natural beauty and health products, and more THE DETAILS Where | Pedlar St. Galle Fort, Galle Sri Lanka dreamin’: 31 things you can’t miss in Sri Lanka #7 TAKE A CINNAMON EXPERIENCE TOUR We’re firm believers that cinnamon is the greatest spice; and as one of Sri Lanka’s most treasured spices it holds a special place in the country’s culinary and cultural heritage. The country also supplies 80% of the world’s best-quality cinnamon. Used in both sweet and savoury dishes, it’s an absolute staple of Sri Lankan cuisine. Eager to learn more about how something so delicious is cultivated, we took a short guided tour with the Cinnamon Experience, visiting a local family who have been farming cinnamon for generations. We sipped cinnamon tea while exploring the verdant plantation, learning exactly how cinnamon is harvested, extracted, peeled, and eventually ground down to a fine powder. Seeing the (literal) hands-on nature of the process gave us a much deeper appreciation of the spice and its importance not only to Sri Lankan cuisine but also to its Ayurvedic traditions. We also left with the most delicious-smelling bag of fresh, organic cinnamon straight from the source, which was a genuine highlight of the trip, given our love of cinnamon. THE DETAILS BOOK | You can book the Cinnamon Experience directly here Sri lanka’s beachside paradise | our guide to Unawatuna #8 EAT LOCAL & SAMPLE SRI LANKAN STREET FOOD The sheer amount of high-end restaurants within the walls of Galle Fort is astounding, and more are popping up with each visit. And while it’s wonderful to have an array of international options at your fingertips, we feel it would be remiss to visit Galle and not sample some of the local cuisine. A handful of wonderful local eateries still thrive among the Fort’s cobbled streets, serving up hearty, authentic Sri Lankan fare at affordable prices. They’re often small and lacking in air conditioning, but they’re full of atmosphere and genuinely delicious meals. In our view, supporting local spots is important not only for the experience but to ensure that the spread of tourism dollars goes to the local community and not just large hospitality groups. To use the words of our culinary idol, Anthony Bourdain, “Food, culture, people, and landscape are all absolutely inseparable” On the menu is rice and curry, the staple of the Sri Lankan diet, blending warm spices, coconut, vegetables, and occasionally meat (generally fish) to form the most delicious of flavours. So our recommendations for local restaurants in Galle Fort? COCONUT SAMBOL | Blink and you’ll miss it, Coconut Sambol is a hole-in-the-wall restaurant serving rice & curry from the heavens. It’s self-service, so pile your plate high and enjoy the intricate flavours and textures of each curry (our particular favourite was the carrot curry). Wash it down with homemade ginger beer, which, we might add, is one of the greatest drinks we’ve ever consumed. IMALS RESTAURANT | Set on the bottom floor of a dilapidated double-storey colonial building, Imals is one of the more popular local establishments. Enjoy flavoursome curries and other local delights under the ever-present whir of an overworked fan. The dhal is rich in coconut flavour, while the brinjal (sweet, almost caramelised eggplant curry) is the star of the show. Grab a mango lassie to cool down AMEEN ROTI | A proper street food vendor (and one of the last left in the Fort), Ameen serves roti, wade, and other Sri Lankan street food. We highly recommend the egg roti, with a side of dhal. Additionally, the wade (fried chickpea snack) is delish We highly recommend that you visit and support one of these restaurants, as they are the fabric of local life within the Fort. If you’re keen to learn more about Sri Lankan cuisine beyond just eating it, we suggest joining a cooking class in Galle Fort. The Fort has a burgeoning cooking class scene, and joining a class is the best way to truly understand and educate yourself about Sri Lankan dishes. Consider this highly-rated class and visit a local market, before learning to cook flavourful curries. BOOK | Sri Lankan cooking class + market tour in Galle Fort #9 HIT THE BEACHES OF NEARBY UNAWATUNA Despite its position on the sparkling southern coast of Sri Lanka, Galle lacks in iconic beaches. Fortunately, as is the case in a country such as Sri Lanka, epic beaches are just a short bus, tuk-tuk, or scooter away. The horseshoe-shaped Unawatuna main beach is one of the most popular beaches in the country for both tourists and locals alike. While the beach isn’t the best in Sri Lanka, it’s still a wonderful place to enjoy a swim, with abundant coral reefs and decent waves. We suggest swimming in the middle or to the south of the beach, where there are fewer people and boats. Alternatively, you can rent a sunbed and relax, order cocktails and curries from the beachside bars, or take an afternoon stroll up to the pagoda north of the beach and watch the sunset. Unawatuna is also home to Jungle beach , a stretch of white sand & turquoise waters backed by jungle on the Rumassala outcrop, overlooking Galle Fort on the opposite side of Galle bay. While it's not the best beach in Sri Lanka, it's far quieter than Unawatuna main beach and definitely worth half a day's visit. Alternatively, the beautiful, bustling beachside town of Hikkaduwa", "images":

From the best things to do, where to stay, how to get there, and where to eat - we’ve got you covered with this in-depth post on our favourite destination in Sri Lanka! UPDATED - JULY 2024 After a long and sweaty three-hour tuk-tuk ride from Unawatuna , we arrived at Hiriketiya Beach on the southern coast of Sri Lanka . It was love at first sight. Palm-fringed golden sands, surfers carving up sweet left-handers, cool cafes serving up incredibly fresh brunch worthy of any Melbourne cafe; this was a place so beautiful, so peaceful, and so perfect that we knew we'd definitely arrived in heaven. Funnily enough, Hiriketiya Beach wasn’t a stop we were planning to make on our original Sri Lanka itinerary , but with a need for just a little more ocean therapy before heading north and the chance to hang out with new travel buddies, we decided to head to this jungle paradise on a whim - and boy are we glad we did. What was once a sleepy hidden gem on Sri Lanka’s south coast with little more than a few wooden huts is fast becoming the ‘it’ place for digital nomads and their acai bowls, bronzed surfers riding waves all day long, and salty-haired wanderers chilling into a new level of zen. There are surf shops that wouldn’t look out of place in any cool coastal town, beachside bars serving up cocktails from mason jars, and many co-working spaces have popped up in recent years. As of our most recent visit in 2024, the Hiri of old is clinging on for dear life, fighting the dreaded perils of over-tourism of Canggu (and all of Bali, for that matter) in what seems like, at times, a losing battle. It’s scary, seeing a place you love so dearly, falling prey to the ‘progress’. But despite all this progress, Hiriketiya still manages to be the kind of place where the thick jungle meets the sea and time becomes irrelevant - and we love it for it. Just don’t come expecting a quiet, zen-like bay - those days are now long gone. If you’re planning a trip along Sri Lanka’s southern coastline (follow our three-week Sri Lanka itinerary here), you need to add a couple of days in Hiriketiya to your itinerary. From what to do, where to stay, and our favourite day trips, this is everything you need to know! LOVE OUR PHOTOS? Edit like us with our Tropical Dreams Preset Packs , and Tropical Bliss mobile video filters, inspired by the tropical beauty and colour of this beautiful country HIRIKETIYA BEACH TRAVEL GUIDE ESSENTIALS WHERE | Southern Sri Lanka BEST HOTELS | Jasper House , Le Cabanon & Dots Bay House WHAT TO SEE & DO | Learn to surf, daily yoga, visit Dondra Lighthouse, chill WHERE TO EAT & DRINK | Smoke & Bitters, Bahia, Dots, Mahu Poke Bowls HOW TO GET THERE | Train or bus from Colombo, tuk-tuk from surrounding areas WHAT TO KNOW| Save water, bring a reusable water bottle WHERE TO STAY IN HIRIKETIYA Across our many visits to Hiriketiya, we’ve found accommodation in the area can be a bit hit-and-miss. However, with new openings post-Covid catering to all budgets, accommodation options are plentiful. To help you choose the right place, we’ve curated the best places to stay in Hiriketiya guide. If you’re short on time, below are our three favourite hotels: JASPER HOUSE | 12 airy rooms feature beautiful rooms with local furniture, antique decor, and a few steps to the surf. BOOK | Prices and availability here SALT HOUSE | 4* laidback hotel/yoga studio/surf camp with beautiful, minimalistic rooms. BOOK | Prices and availability here ﻿ DOTS BAY HOUSE | More of a ‘hostel’ vibe, but cool and close to Hiriketiya Beach. BOOK | Prices and availability here MOND TREESCAPES | A beautiful, modern, minimalist treehouse in the jungles outside of Hiri. Pretty much the stuff of dreams Alternatively, search for all hotel options for Hiriketiya and Dikwella on booking.com here TOP THINGS TO DO IN HIRIKETIYA BEACH SURF, SURF, SURF AT HIRIKETIYA BEACH Slowly becoming one of Sri Lanka's premier surf destinations, Hiriketiya Beach is the perfect place to learn to ride the waves or to take your surfing skills to the next level. Located on a horseshoe-shaped bay with waves rolling in almost all year (10 months in fact), Hiriketiya Beach provides a challenge for all grades of surfers. There are two breaks at Hiriketiya Beach, the reef break, located in the eastern corner of the bay, and the ever-popular beach break, which is more centrally located. The reef break is definitely one for the more experienced surfers, with fast left hander that lasts for close to 100m, making it one of the better waves on the south coast. The beach break is perfect for intermediates and beginners, and can roughly be split into two sections - further into the bay is where the waves tend to start, and where the intermediates line up. Further towards the beach is where you’ll find beginners and their teachers, attempting their first ride. A word of warning though - as of our most recent visit (2024), it’s pretty hectic out there. Hiri’s popularity has skyrocketed, and as a result, it’s virtually impossible to score a wave without 100 others dropping in on you. The solution? Get up at the break of dawn and beat the rush. The smaller swell during the peak season (Dec - Feb) is great for beginners, while the waves are at their best during Aug- Dec when intermediate/experienced surfers can take on the left-handers rolling perfectly into shore. Beginners’ can still surf during this time, but it’s best to try your luck on the sandier beach break. Boards can be hired from the water’s edge and for 300 LKR per hour ($1.50!), it's an absolute bargain. Also, please remember to use surfing etiquette and respect the locals and their waves. In our experience, Weligama may be a better place to learn to surf (that’s where we learnt!), although for those with better skills surfing in Hiriketiya Bay is incredible. THE DETAILS Where | Hiriketiya Beach Book | You can book surf lessons at Hiri Surf School The best of Lanka | 31 awesome things to do in Sri Lanka SWIM & CHILL AT HIRIKETIYA BEACH Not into surfing? Fortunately, Hiriketiya beach is a great place to chill and while the days away. During our stay, we made a habit of heading down each afternoon to relax, swim, and watch the vibrant Sri Lankan sunsets light up the sky. The palm-fringed beach isn't the widest nor the most golden-sanded in Sri Lanka, but the setting is magical and the water clear. Although surfers fill the bay come midday, there's always enough room to swim and there are even turtles that swim in the shallows if you're lucky enough to spot one! If you're after a cheap eat, Roti Hut serves cheap roti and coconuts to the left of the beach - although if you’re in a rush, be warned: we did have to wait about an hour for ours! Hiriketiya isn’t the only beach in the area though. Dickwella, a short 15-minute walk away, is far more expansive, allowing for a more relaxed beachside experience - think Mirissa Beach without the crowds (see more below). Alternatively, if you looking to explore beaches around the southern coast, we recommend the following: Talalla Beach | About 30 mins drive west from Hiri, an exquisite white-sand cove flanked by coconut trees Goyambokka | A hidden beach off the main tourist road, about 30 mins drive east of Hiri, Goyambokka is a dream, flanked by palms and chilled eateries Silent Beach | Located just before Goyambokka, Silent beach is just that - silent. A long stretch of golden sand all to yourself. Just be careful during the offseason as the swell can get rough AFTERNOONS & SUNSETS AT DICKWELLA BEACH (PEHEMBIYA BEACH) Hiriketiya Beach is rather small and due to its size, can get very busy at times, especially during the morning surf lesson rush, or in the later afternoon chill time. Nearby Dickwella Beach is far larger, with a long stretch of white sand that seems to go on for miles. And dare we say, it’s now our favoured beach in the area, offering a diverse mix of activities, beach bars, and large swathes of sand. And less crowds. The calmer eastern end, known as Pehembiya Beach (adjacent to Smoke & Bitters), has become a popular rival to Hiriketiya’s bustling sands, with rustic beach bars popping up along its palm-lined fringes. The affordable beach beds, ample King Coconuts, and golden sand make it a wonderful place to spend the day, and it’s also the perfect place to settle in for the afternoon before a famous Sri Lankan sunset commences. Machan Place is the pick of the bunch, offering delicious smoothies & drinks, Sri Lankan street food, and affordable sun beds. Due to its west-facing position, you’ll watch the sky turn all hues of the rainbow before setting into the Indian Ocean, and it’s a mesmerising experience to enjoy. Finish the day at Smoke & Bitters for the most incredible gastro-experience (see below). All Aboard | Our Guide to the Kandy to Ella Train BEACH CLUB VIBES AT LA PLAYA On our most recent trip to Hiriketiya, we were surprised (read: shocked) to see the towering La Playa Hiriketiya set right on the beach - Hiri had previously felt like it was avoiding the perils of mass tourism, but seeing La Playa felt like the dawn of the development era for this little coastal paradise. The building itself is stylish and blends with the surroundings, while the beach club fuses contemporary chic and tropical aesthetics, reminiscent of some of Bali’s best beach clubs. The music is great, the food delicious, and the cocktails wonderful, but it just feels a little out of place when compared to the surrounding offerings. Now, don’t let us dissuade you from visiting and enjoying yourself in the sun-drenched lap pool while sipping cocktails, for La Playa is perfect for those seeking a more upmarket, boho-vibe. Maybe we’re getting old and sentimental, but we hold the old Hiri close to our hearts, and any major development to the beachside is hard to handle. THE DETAILS Where | La Playa, Hiriketiya Beach Cost | $$ BOOK | You can also stay right on the beachfront at La Playa, which you can book here BOUTIQUES & COLLECTIVES | THE BEST SHOPPING IN HIRI Sri Lanka might not be as renowned for shopping, design and textiles as Vietnam or Thailand, but across its bohemian hotspots, with their mix of international and local creatives, there’s a growing scene of designers producing exceptional goods. Hiriketiya is one such place, home to a burgeoning scene of local and international designers producing everything from swimwear to art. The excellent Le Ketiya Boutique , owned by South African native Gabby, specialises in luxury swimwear, tropical clothing, surf accessories and more, and is the perfect place to grab stylish bikinis, sarongs or flowing linen. Nearby, The Village Collective is a Sri Lankan artisan store showcasing locally-produced art, homewares and lifestyle brands. Think wall art, candles, cosmetics and sustainably sourced tea and coffee. We grabbed a Hiriketiya print for our wall, just to remind us of our favourite place in the world. The Verse Collective has a small boutique on site, which has a range of surf products in case you lose/forget yours at home - it’s expensive but came in handy when Mark lost his boardies in HIkkaduwa. MARVEL AT BLUE BEACH, NILWELLA Tucked away in nearby Nilwella lies Blue Beach, a bright-white sandbar that connects the mainland with a ubiquitous palm-filled rocky Sri Lankan outcrop. It’s a photographer’s heaven, especially from above (via drone), with the unique aspects providing some super cool photo opportunities. On a calm day, the beach is a wonderful place to relax and enjoy a swim away from the crowds of Hiriketiya Beach - just don’t forget to bring some food and water, as the beach has little in the way of amenities. For divers and snorkellers, the newly created Nilwella Underwater Gallery is a super-cool place to explore the unique beauty of Sri Lanka’s aquatic life. The gallery features a myriad of sculptures, structures and artificial reefs, designed to increase breeding grounds for local fish species and create new coral reefs that encourage tourism. To go diving or snorkelling, enquire about your accommodation in Hiriketiya. If you’re into camping, the private island houses a super cool campground - just make sure you get permission (and pay a fee) before camping there. THE DETAILS Where | Blue Beach, Nilwella How to get there | Get to Nilwella fishing village via tuk-tuk, around 300 LKR each way GET YOUR DAILY DOSE OF YOGA AT SALT HOUSE For those who love a yoga session or two on holiday (us!), Salt House in Hiriketiya is the perfect place. With an open elevated Shala set amongst the jungles of Hiriketiya, a yoga session at Salt House is truly relaxing. Unless you do a vinyasa flow session, in which case it'll be truly exhausting. Salt House also hosts yoga and surf retreats, so if you're looking to completely zen out for a week in Hiri you’d do well to join one of these. They also have some of the most beautiful designed accommodation in Hiriketiya, check out prices and availability on Booking.com . THE DETAILS Where | Yoga at Salt House Cost | Free for guests Book | Salt House, Hiriketiya ENJOY AN AYURVEDIC MASSAGE If it’s not already abundantly clear, Hiriketiya is a place for relaxation. Here, a morning surf takes priority over emails, midday yoga is a habit, and an afternoon massage is essential. So, if you’re visiting Hiri, make sure you book yourself in for an ayurvedic massage. In Sri Lanka, massages mostly involve Ayurveda, the holistic science that looks at physical, emotional, and spiritual balance. An ayurvedic massage focuses on relaxation, stress relief and promotes the release of emotional blockages, through the use of essential oils and herbs. In short, it’s the perfect antidote to the energy expended while surfing, and the perfect accompaniment to yoga. In Hiriketiya, there is a range of Ayurveda massage options, including Tonic Spa, located just north of the main beach. They offer a range of massage treatments, from deep tissue to relaxation, body/face scrubs and herbal baths (treatments start from 3,500LKR). Another option is to book through your accommodation, or through the Salt House, or Jasper House.

Completed in 1890, Dondra lighthouse is Sri Lanka's tallest, and in our opinion, most impressive (although the Galle Fort lighthouse pushes it hard!). The stunning coastal setting, beautiful palms, and lack of tourists means it'll be worth the effort to visit - trust us. Entry is free and it's easy to get to - hire a tuk tuk to take you directly there, or catch the local bus from Dikwella to Dondra, and walk to the lighthouse from the town centre. THE DETAILS Where | Dondra Lighthouse Road, Dondra Cost | Free entry Opening hours | 09:00 am - 19:00 pm every day How to get to Dondra Lighthouse | Local bus is LKR 50 one way from Dickwella Tuk tuk LKR 500-800 depending on passengers Your ultimate guide to Galle Fort EAT, WORK, CHILL, REPEAT AT VERSE COLLECTIVE Hiriketiya has become somewhat of a Digital Nomad hotspot, so if you're like us and work online, stumbling across somewhere as cool as Verse Collective on your travels is always a bonus. One afternoon (with urgent-soon-to-be-overdue deadlines pending, of course) we paid them a visit. With fast internet, tasty food and refreshing drinks, it was a welcome relief from our cramped hostel room work sessions (as of 2024, free wifi is no more - charged at LKR 2,000 per day). Located off Pehembiya Beach in Dikwella, Verse Collective is one of Sri Lanka's first co-working spaces. It features a huge open-plan layout, chillout couches, a cafe, and a skatepipe, allowing procrastination sessions to take a whole new meaning. Verse Collective also doubles as a hostel/guesthouse, with super cool dorm and double rooms in the complex, so if you're an 'eat, work, sleep, repeat' kinda person, Verse Collective is your place. Alternatively, The Salty Pelican is another option located nearby. THE DETAILS Where | Verse Collective, Dikwella Opening hours | Daily - 7.30 am - 9 pm heading north: top things to do in Jaffna, Sri Lanka’s northern capital A UNIQUE CULTURAL FIX AT WEWRUKANNALA VIHARAYA BUDDHIST TEMPLE Looking to explore something more than the beaches and breaks of Hiriketiya, our kind Airbnb hosts suggested we spend time at Wewrukannala Viharaya Buddhist temple, 1.5kms outside of Dikwella; \"it's very unique, you must visit\" they reiterated. Unique is probably an understatement. Wewrukannala Viharaya draws visitors from all over the country to see the giant Buddha statue, which at 50m in height, is the tallest in Sri Lanka . However, the most unique (and frankly terrifying) part of the temple complex is the Buddhist Hall of Horrors, a long corridor illustrated with ghastly depictions of Buddhist hell. With each step through the tunnel, we gasped with horror (and a little laughter) as each depiction became more and more shocking. Highlights, if you can call them that, include sinners being disembowelled, viciously (and graphically) castrated, sawn in half, stabbed with spears, and hacked to pieces. It takes around an hour to explore the complex - just don't get locked in the hall of horrors, whatever you do.

Arriving at 7 am, we watched as wily fisherman slowly returned to the harbour in traditional outriggers, their arrival triggering a frenzied auction amongst wholesalers looking to snap up the morning's catch. It was all over in about 30 minutes, and while it was definitely an insightful experience, it shouldn't be top of your list of things to do in Hiriketiya unless you're seeking authentic, cultural experiences. Also - be aware that there are many packs of stray dogs around this area, and unlike the rest of Sri Lanka’s strays, these ones were a wee bit aggressive. THE DETAILS Where | Nilwella fishing village How to get there | Get to Nilwella fishing village via tuk-tuk, around 300r each way WHERE TO EAT AND DRINK IN HIRIKETIYA SMOKE & BITTERS Sri Lanka is home to some of the best sunsets you could ever wish to see. And now Sri Lanka is home to a cocktail bar rated in the top 100 in Asia (read more here ); Smoke & Bitters, located just outside of Hiri, at Pehembiya Beach. Merge the best sunsets with the best cocktails (and food), and add a palm-filled space and excellent staff, and you have probably the best night out in Sri Lanka. And we should know; we’ve now spent an evening here on two separate trips to Hirikietiya, and both times we’ve walked away agreeing that it was, in fact, the best meal we’ve ever had (Hyperbole? Maybe. Delicious? Yes.). Smoke & Bitters opened in early 2020 before the pandemic took hold and ceased international travel for the better part of two years. Thankfully, the team at Smoke & Bitters worked hard to keep the business afloat, honing their cocktail varieties and locally sourced ingredients (bitters, syrups, liqueurs and spirit infusions are made in-house!), to create the perfect cocktail menu. A must-have cocktail is a signature Mai Chai, wh", "images":

Here’s our selection of the best activities, plus our short guide to the city on where to stay, eat, and how to get around! UPDATED - July 2024 Tucked away in the misty Sri Lankan high country, amongst idyllic green hills and gushing waterfalls lies Ella: one of this tear-shaped island's most appealing destinations. From scaling the heady heights of Ella Rock to laying eyes on the mystical Nine Arch Bridge for the very first time; standing on the edge of the roaring Diyaluma Falls (the second tallest in the country), and winding through the tea plantations and mountains passes on the famous Kandy to Ella train ; many of our favourite Sri Lankan adventures can be found right here. At its heart, Ella is a charming and laid-back village perfect for relaxing, hiking and escaping the searing temperatures of the southern coast. It's a place where Sri Lanka's colonial heritage coexists with its rich Sinhalese and Tamil culture, and where abundant natural experiences can be found alongside plentiful cultural ones. And it's a place where learning to cook delicious Sri Lankan cuisine is an absolute must (NOM!). We do have to warn you, that this once simple hamlet in the hills has transformed into a major tourist stop since our first visit in 2016. Growing in popularity and in size has led to a number of concrete eyesores now dotting every corner of the village, which has taken away some of the peaceful, rural charms that made the area so incredible. But there’s still so much to see and do in Ella - if you’re willing to go deeper than just the touristy pretty sights and epic landscapes. After two visits to this lush hill-country village, we've put together our list of the best things to do in Ella, Sri Lanka; a town we feel should be firmly embedded on your Sri Lankan itinerary .

Edit like us with our Tropical Dreams Preset Packs , and Tropical Bliss mobile video filters, inspired by the tropical beauty and colour of this beautiful country ELLA ATTRACTIONS OVERVIEW WHERE | Hill Country, Sri Lanka HOW TO GET THERE | Kandy to Ella Train, bus from Kandy, tuk-tuk from southern beaches WHAT TO SEE & DO | Nine Arch Bridge, Little Adams Peak, Ella Rock, Kandy to Ella train, Zip line WHERE TO EAT & DRINK | Chill Cafe, Matey Hut WHERE TO STAY | Rowinrich Cottages , Chill Ville Viewpoint Hotel , 98 Acres Resort and Spa WHAT TO KNOW| Save water, bring a reusable water bottle WHERE TO STAY IN ELLA There’s a whole myriad of accommodation options opening up all over Ella, including luxurious eco-hotels in the jungle canopy, hostels popping up in town, and a number of budget and mid-range hotels and guesthouses offering the perfect pillow for any budget or travel style. We’ve written a full guide on where to stay in Ella , which covers everything you need to know about Ella accommodation, plus our recommendations for everything from hostel beds to luxurious stays. READ | Our guide to where to stay in Ella, Sri Lanka OUR RECOMMENDED HOTELS IN ELLA Despite being the centre of a tourism boom, accommodation in Ella is quite easy to come by and is literally teeming with low to mid-end hotels. We’ve recommended three hotels below: ROWINRICH COTTAGES | Spacious loft-style cottages with terraces overlooking the jungle-clad valley and Ella Rock. Prices and availability here CHILL VILLE VIEWPOINT HOTEL | great value hotel is set amongst beautiful gardens close to the Nine Arch Bridge .

Prices and availability here THE BEST THINGS TO DO IN ELLA, SRI LANKA #1 RIDE ABOARD THE KANDY TO ELLA TRAIN Hotter than the London Underground on a summer’s day, takes eight hours yet only costs £5. Sounds a little like hell, but trust us, the train ride from Kandy to Ella is the best thing you'll do in Sri Lanka (read our complete guide to the Kandy to Ella train here — it also includes how to book and our insider travel tips). Winding through misty forests, verdant tea plantations; over gushing waterfalls and streams, and past colourful towns and excitable locals, this is, in our opinion, the most picturesque train ride in the world. But it's not just the scenery that makes this train ride so incredible. It's also the vibe. Every person you encounter seems to greet you with a genuine smile; groups of local boys play sing, dance and play the drums; vendors rush through the train spruiking sweet chai and snacks, while tourists hang their heads out the windows to stare in amazement at the sheer beauty. Literally, everyone is wide-eyed and happy, which in this day and age is hard to find. The most scenic part of the journey is from Nanu Oya to Ella, through the dense forest of the Horton Plains national park, so we recommend getting the window seat or standing in between the doorways, and enjoying the views as they pass by. When we first visited Sri Lanka in 2016, the Kandy to Ella train ride was yet to really hit the big time, however, due to its current popularity, you need to book your travel in advance (usually 1 - 2 days prior). The train may also be quite crowded, especially during peak season, so be warned you may need to push your way on. Third class may be the cheapest option, and in our opinion, it's also the best as it allows you to sit/hang out of the doorways. You’ll also find it’s filled with friendly locals keen to help you enjoy your experience. THE DETAILS Where | Ella Train Station, Ella Cost | 2nd class: LKR 240 per person, 3rd class: LKR 175 per person Kandy to Ella train times | Express trains depart Ella to Kandy - at 0640 and 0924 (subject to change) Read more | Our complete guide to the Kandy to Ella train BOOK | Tickets for the Kandy to Ella train can also be booked at 12go.asia our complete sri lanka travel guide (including our 3 week itinerary) #2 ADMIRE ELLA’S FAMOUS NINE-ARCH BRIDGE It's astonishing to think that a bridge could drive tourists in droves to Ella, yet the Nine Arch Bridge , just outside the town, has done just that. The Nine Arch Bridge is flanked by verdant forests and tea plantations, standing proudly across the valley below. On misty days, a low cloud hangs in the valley, giving the whole area a moody, mystical feel. Completed in 1921, the Nine Arch Bridge is built entirely out of brick, rock and cement, with no metal used in its construction - an engineering feat back in those days. Spanning 91 meters at a height of 24 feet, the bridge is on the famous Kandy to Bandarawela (via Ella) train line , with trains passing around five times a day, depending on the ever-changing Sri Lankan train timetable. Although train times are notoriously unreliable in Sri Lanka, trains tend to pass the Nine Arch Bridge around the following times: 9:30, 11:30, 15:30, 16:30, and 17:30 ( read our comprehensive guide here! ). There are many places to view the bridge from, with the most popular being from the actual bridge itself, and below from the tea plantation (this is private land, so please ask for permission before entering). But for us, the best views are from above, either looking from the forests surrounding the bridge or from one of the cafe platforms in the surrounding hills. Watching the train slowly make its way across the bridge is a wonderful sight. Just get there early, as the Bridge and surrounding viewpoints fill up VERY quickly! THE DETAILS Where | Nine Arches Bridge, Ella Cost | FREE How to get to Nine Arch Bridge, Ella | You can catch a tuk-tuk from Ella town to the Nine Arch Bridge for around LKR 200-300, which is the quickest and easiest option. Alternatively, you can walk there by following the Ella - Passara Rd, turning left at Sri Kanaser Temple (where all the street food stalls are). Follow the signs, which will take you past multiple guesthouses until you arrive at the Nine Arch Bridge.

Starting at the famous Ella train station, you’ll follow the Ella to Kandy train line past many beautiful waterfalls, bridges, tea plantations, and homes, before starting your ascent towards the Ella Rock summit - hopefully with a King Coconut in hand for some extra energy. We definitely needed it; the hike to the summit under that fierce sun is tough! Once at the summit, we enjoyed the incredible views for at least an hour, munching away on our vegetarian roti and some well-deserved water. The route to the summit can be a little complicated, however, if you follow the clearly marked paths and ignore the (sometimes deliberately misleading) touts, you shouldn't have too many issues (this in-depth post will help you get there). All up, the hike takes around 2 hours round trip, but remember to pack enough water and snacks to power your journey.

Named after its similarly shaped, yet far taller older brother, Adam’s Peak, the Little Adam’s Peak hike takes about two-hours roundtrip from Ella town, and starts in the lush tea plantations before slowly snaking its way to the first set of viewpoints. From here, you'll have 360-degree views overlooking the giant Ella Rock and Ella Gap towards Udawalawe National Park, perfect for photos. We'd definitely advise continuing the hike further down the ridge, as the views become more spectacular and less busy. The return route follows the other side of the mountain, overlooking the incredible 98 Acres resort before slowly making its way back to Ella. Stop at the little wooden juice hut on the return journey back to relax and grab a refreshing king coconut. We recommend hiking up during the late afternoon and watching the glorious sunset unfold; and definitely advise against hiking during the middle of the day as there's little shade to hide from the glaring sun - one of our worst-ever travel burns happened right here! THE DETAILS Where | Little Adam’s Peak, Ella Cost | FREE How to get to Little Adams Peak | It’s possible to catch a tuk-tuk to the base of Little Adam’s Peak, before following the sign-posted pathway to the peak. It’s also a very easy walk from Ella town. Walk the Ella - Passara Rd, turning right at Ella Flower Garden resort before following the signs to Little Adam’s Peak. surf + chill | our guide to hiriketiya, sri lanka’s hidden paradise #5 WITNESS THE BEAUTY OF DIYALUMA FALLS Forget what the pop songs tell you, Sri Lanka's second tallest waterfall, Diyaluma Fall s is so impressive that you absolutely do need to chase waterfalls here. Cascading from high in the Sri Lanka mountains, Diyaluma may be a little off the beaten track, but the epic views and natural infinity pools make the 1.5-2-hour journey more than worth the effort. To get to Diyaluma, we jumped in a tuk-tuk from Ella to Poonagala, through quintessentially Sri Lankan tea plantations. Once we’d arrived in the small village of Poonagala, we set off hiking downhill through long, dry grass for around 30mins before getting our first glimpse of the upper Diyaluma falls. A short walk further and there we were, standing above a sheer 220m rush of water to the valley floor below. It was amazing. At this point, we need to warn you that safety barriers do not exist, so if you're an adrenaline junkie (like Mark), and like to stand on the edge of just about anything, please be careful. During the summer months when the water levels have dropped, you can enjoy a refreshing swim at the falls' various natural pools, including right on the edge of the main waterfall. Alternatively, there are larger, safer pools at the upper Diyaluma falls, but again, take precautions before diving in. There are two ways to get to the top of Diyaluma falls - either hiking from the bottom, which is rather strenuous and hard to follow, or from Poonagala village, which is far shorter yet less popular. THE DETAILS Where | Diyaluma Falls, Ella How to get to Diyaluma Falls | Take a tuk-tuk from Ella town to Poonagala (LKR 3,500 - 5,000 return) and hike from the car park down to the falls. Alternatively, take a tuk-tuk to the town of Koslanda and hike up to Diyaluma falls.

According to local legend, King Ravana is said to have kidnapped princess Sita and hidden her in the secrecy of the forest-protected caves behind the waterfall, to avenge the slicing off of his sister’s nose by Sita’s husband (Rama). Today, the 25m high, multi-tiered waterfall is less hidden, given its location right next to the road into Ella from the south, but it’s no less impressive, particularly if you make the effort to hike further up to the second and third-tier falls. From the top of Ravana falls the views over the valley below are majestic, and worth the somewhat tough and precarious hike up. To get to the top, follow the tracks to the right of the waterfall and slowly make your way up, following the well-trodden paths. Be warned though - due to the sheer volume of water this hike should only be completed during the dry months, and with the assistance of a local guide. During the wet months, the torrent that flows down this waterfall is a sight to behold, showering the road and local area in a spray. We recommend visiting early morning or late afternoon, as the area can get pretty busy during the day. Also, be sure to grab a King Coconut (LKR 50) or boiled corn (LKR 50) at one of the street vendors before heading back to Ella! THE DETAILS Where | Ravana Falls, Ella Cost | Free How to get to Ravana Falls | We recommend catching a tuk-tuk from Ella, which should cost around LKR 200 - 400 and take around 15mins. Alternatively, you can hike there, following the Wellawaya-Ella-Kumbalwela Hwy until you reach the falls, however, we don't recommend this due to the length and slight chaos of the traffic! visiting central sri lanka? you must visit pidurangala rock #7 PARTY, EAT, AND CHILL IN ELLA TOWN If you’re coming to Sri Lanka looking for a full-on party destination like Thailand or Bali, we need to let you down now because this country is definitely NOT your place. That said, Ella is the one place in Sri Lanka where western food and a small, but a decent, night out exists for those who seek it. Central to Ella’s backpacker scene is the main street, which has seen a radical transformation (for the worse, in our opinion) over the last few years. What was once a sleepy, quaint main street filled with local markets and restaurants is now a throbbing hub home to hip new cafes and bars, boutique shops, and a vibe that feels slightly more like that of an Asian backpacker town. If you’re keen to get into the mix, the best place to take it all in is at Cafe Chill, located right in the centre of town. Serving delicious western-style food, cocktails and a decent soundtrack, Cafe Chill is where the cool kids hang out. At night, the upper deck becomes a bar/lounge, perfect for a few Lion Beers. We can highly recommend the vegetarian burger, which was our western-style treat during a month of eating rice and curry. Further towards the train station are a number of relaxed bars serving beers and cocktails, some of which are open 24 hours, including the Bob Marley-inspired Cafe One Love.

This is the famous viewpoint where entrepreneur and tea mogul, Sir Thomas Lipton, used to sit and contemplate his vast plantation and the magnificence of Sri Lanka's high country and sample some of the world's finest tea straight from the source. Unfortunately, we weren't able to enjoy the panoramic views as we would have liked thanks to heavy rain and dense fog surrounding the summit upon our arrival, however, we’re told (by our tuk-tuk driver) that on a clear day, you can see as far as Udawalawe National park and beyond to Hambantota port. Despite the inclement weather, we definitely enjoyed our fresh cup of Sri Lankan tea (LKR 50 per person) at the top, while watching the clouds roll by. The tea, we both agreed, was by far the best we've ever consumed. The drive from Haputale station through the verdant tea fields and colourful towns was also stunning, so if the weather’s looking a bit iffy, we’d still recommend venturing at least part of the way there just for the scenery. If you're looking to visit Lipton Seat from Ella, we’d advise taking the 6 am Ella to Kandy train and jumping off at Haputale (let’s face it, any excuse to spend additional time on that train is well worth it - it's amazing!), and then pay a tuk-tuk driver to take you to Lipton Seat from the station (LKR 2000 - 3000 for a return trip). A visit to Lipton Seat and tea plantation tour (more on that below) should take around four hours, providing you with enough time to return to the station for the 11 am return train to Ella. Alternatively, book this best-selling day tour from Ella which includes Lipton Seat and a Dambatenne Tea Factory tour. Check prices and availability here . THE DETAILS Where | Lipton Seat, Haputhale Cost | LKR 100 per person. If arriving via tuk-tuk, an additional LKR 50 charge applies Opening hours | 06:00 am - 17:00pm daily How to get to Lipton Seat | Catch the Ella to Kandy train to Haputale, then tuk-tuk to Lipton seat.

Or that tea bushes cover 25% of Sri Lanka's surface? Nope, neither did we until we toured the tea factory in Haputale. Considering the Dambethenne factory was built by the great tea man himself (Lipton), it’s a pretty darn good place to learn all about what makes this country (and most of the world) tick. Just north of the town of Haputale, this tour will take you through the whole tea production process in great detail, from the picking, rolling, drying, fermenting, cutting, sieving and grading of the tea, through to the final auction process (80% is on sold to Colombo and exported to the world). For an avid tea drinker like Mim, learning the science behind a perfect cuppa was enlightening and something we definitely recommend for any traveller visiting Sri Lanka . THE DETAILS Where | Dambethenne tea factory, Badulla Cost | LKR 250 per person Opening hours | 09:00 am - 17:00pm, Mon - Sat.

{"url": "https://www.thecommonwanderer.com/blog/ahangama-sri-lanka", "title": "10+ Incredible Things To Do In Ahangama, Sri Lanka | The Common Wanderer", "publish_date": "Apr 11", "text": "The Best Things to do in Ahangama, Sri Lanka’s Bohemian Hotspot Asia Sri Lanka Apr 11 Written By The Common Wanderer A palm-tree-lined beach treasure along Sri Lanka’s southern coastline, Ahangama has exploded onto the travel scene in recent years. In this guide, you’ll find everything you need to know to plan your visit, including where to stay, eat, and play, how to get there, and plenty more. The story of Sri Lanka ’s southern coastal town of Ahangama is unfurling just as that of many coastal spots often does: hushed whispers of a palm-fringed coastline where the surf is perfect, the living breezy. A secret paradise where barefoot wanderers and salty surfers, burnouts and those-in-the-know alike put down roots and enjoy a slower, coconut-fuelled existence. For a time, this was also the tale of Unawatuna , Mirissa , and Hikkaduwa further along the Sri Lankan south coast, but as the tourists started flocking and the bamboo scaffolding and sounds of development roared to life, the surfers moved on to find their next barefoot nomad hangout. Ahangama is where they’ve landed. In many ways, it’s surprising that this little slip of coastline along Sri Lanka’s cacophonic Matara highway hasn’t breezed onto the radar of travellers outside the surfing community earlier. Wedged between the ever-popular beach hubs of Unawatuna and Weligama, with easy access from the capital of Colombo and a main drag buzzing with a steady stream of tuk-tuks, roaring buses and noisy daily life, it’s neither sleepy nor tucked away down an adventurous jungle path. The delights of Ahangama are, rather, pretty much laid out right in front of you from the second you reach its fringes. To one side, the rolling Indian ocean tempts bronzed surfing faithful to pay ritual to it morning and night, its sandy shoreline filling up with a mix of surf schools, laidback barefoot beach bar terraces and slick eateries transplanted from the capital or shores further afield. To the other, thick coconut groves flank crumbling colonial-era Art Deco villa fixer-uppers and pot-holey dirt tracks weave between green fields and steaming jungle peppered with colourful homes and the occasional hotel. While many a travel guide would have you believe this is still a sleepy surf and fishing town, we’d disagree - partly. From its quiet, rural beginnings, Ahangama has well and truly emerged as one of Sri Lanka’s ‘it’ places to be and be seen, and that pace is only set to increase in the next few years as more wanderers are drawn to the coastline in search of its surf and culinary and artistic offerings. But where do agree with its sleepy moniker is that, so far, many of the establishments that have popped up have been able to imbue a real sense of sleepy barefoot luxury within their cafes, bars or hotels. It was a vibe we enjoyed enough to have extended our stay in the area, and one we hope continues as the area keeps developing. These are our favourite things to do in Ahangama, plus advice on the best places to rest your head, our favourite spots to eat and enjoy a sunset tipple, and tips on transport connections to help you plan your itinerary.

Edit like us with our Tropical Dreams Preset Packs , and Tropical Bliss mobile video filters, inspired by the tropical beauty and colour of this beautiful country AHANGAMA TRAVEL GUIDE OVERVIEW WHAT TO DO | Lazy beach days, Surf, or learn to surf, day-trip to Galle Fort, visit Handunugoda Tea Estate, pool days at PALM, sunset cocktails WHERE TO STAY | Kurulu Bay , Panta Rei Resor t, or Maria Bonita WHERE TO EAT | The Kip, Hotel de Uncles, Crust pizza, Abode by the Beach HOW TO GET THERE | South coast train, local bus, tuk-tuk, private transfer HOW TO GET AROUND | Tuk-tuk, scooter WHERE TO STAY IN AHANGAMA With Ahangama’s rise in popularity has come an influx of excellent accommodation options in town, catering for all types of travellers - from those who have seen the finest in barefoot luxury, to backpackers keen to get amongst the waves, on as little money as possible. We’ve written a complete guide to Ahangama’s best hotels , but below are our top picks for each budget. KURULU BAY Kurulu Bay is our definition of barefoot luxury and is by far the most beautiful hotel in Ahangama. There are 12 rooms in total, all taking inspiration from Sri Lanka’s greatest architect, Geoffrey Bawa - think polished concrete, bespoke furniture and soft linens, but with 5* luxury in almost every corner, plus a minimalist pool, and poolside terrace, where the excellent restaurant serves up a locally-inspired all-day menu. Balancing luxury, design and nature, Kurulu Bay is the perfect retreat for discerning travellers. BOOK | Kurulu Bay PANTA REI RESORT Panta Rei Resort is the perfect boutique resort for those wanting a little luxury, without the hefty price tag. The resort features 12 bungalows with differing setups, inspired by the boho-minimalism of Bali or Mexico. The rooms are huge, and there’s the large, inviting central pool and leafy communal area, which features a restaurant and bar serving excellent food and cocktails. This is probably the most family-friendly resort on this list, so book away if you’re bringing the family to Sri Lanka. BOOK | Panta Rei Resort MARIA BONITA A hidden gem in Ahangama, Maria Bonita shows that despite the town’s burgeoning popularity, it is possible to find an affordable, quaint hotel that feels like a home away from home. The rooms are thoughtfully decorated, blending tropical charm with a bohemian vibe. While there isn’t a pool, two of Ahangama’s best beaches are just a short tuk-tuk ride away. Christina, the warm and attentive owner, along with her exceptional team, goes above and beyond. From scooter rentals to arranging transport and serving divine banana bread and smoothie bowls, their hospitality is unmatched. BOOK | Maria Bonita WHAT TO SEE AND DO IN AHANGAMA EMBRACE LONG, LAZY BEACH DAYS Ahangama doesn’t tend to be the first coastline that springs to mind when Sri Lanka’s best beaches are being mulled over. Those accolades are usually saved for Hiriketiya , Tangalle, Mirissa , Hikkaduwa, or Unawatuna , though we promise you that that’s all about to change. Once the sleepy, salty secret of the southern coastline, Ahangama’s local beaches have exploded in popularity in recent years, becoming cool not just for surfers in the know, but for everything a beach-lover could want; coconuts, sun beds, beautiful beaches, and plenty of vibe. Kabalana is our pick of the bunch, a wide expanse of sand that, at times, looks like it could be dropped straight from the Maldives. Its golden sands and sun-kissed shores are gorgeous, flanked by towering palms and non-descript beach bars offering delicious kottu and tasty juices. There is a heap of cheap sunbeds to lay your head on after a refreshing dip, and a few surf schools for those keen to learn (it’s probably the best place to learn to surf in Ahangama). We found it the best option for young families too - lots of room to run around and gentle waves at the shoreline. Ahangama Beach (the main beach in the heart of town) is small - no more than 200m long and not very wide - but it is home to all the best beachside bars and cafes, which makes it an appealing stretch of sand. A reef protects the shore from the large Indian Ocean waves, making it the ideal place to relax the day away. It does, however, get very busy, so stick to the western corner for the best stretch of sand. Finally, it wouldn’t be Sri Lanka without mention of a Secret Beach . Ahangama’s secret beach is pretty well kept, a delightful and often deserted cove flanked by palms on the way to Midigama. More chilled than rolling barrels, the beach is protected by boulders which makes it ideal for families. SURF AHANGAMA’S FAMOUS BREAKS, OR LEARN TO SURF Like many of Sri Lanka’s popular beachside towns, Ahangama’s reputation initially grew as a surfing hotspot, with some of the best breaks on the southern coast luring surfers since the 60’s. Lately, it’s gone to a whole new level, with local surf schools and houses offering the surfing community a place to eat, sleep and breathe surfing. Breaks such as Insight/Marshmallows, Sticks, Animals, Gas Stations, Sion, and Dreamsea Left are often busy from dawn to dusk, and the ease of getting between the best breaks along the rest of the southern coastline, be they in Weligama or Unawatuna , makes Ahangama the perfect place to base yourself for a surfing adventure. EXPERIENCED SURFERS If you’re coming to Ahangama to surf, you probably already know of the best breaks. However, below is a little breakdown of the best surf spots in town and surrounds: INSIGHT/MARSHMALLOWS | A r eef break with mellow waves allowing for smooth, long rides. Suitable for intermediate and advanced surfers who know their stuff, as well as beginners who are looking to push themselves (with a guide). The most popular break in town. STICKS | Another reef break for intermediate and advanced surfers. Hard to get out to due to the rocks, but the fast rides with multiple peaks make it worth it. Just watch out for the shallow reef. THE ROCK | A reef break at Kabalana Beach that serves up consistent waves. Nab a famous A-frame and you’ll be in surfing heaven. GAS STATION | Another reef break famous for both left and right-hand waves. Easy to get in and out via the close by beach, which makes it popular. Another for the advanced surfers Beyond Ahangama, some of the best breaks nearby include Lazy Left, Lazy Right, Plantations, Coconuts, and Ram's in Midigama, and Weligama Beach, Fishermen's, and The Island in Weligama. FIRST-TIMER SURF SPOTS For beginner surfers, Kabalana Beach is a great place to learn, with warm waters, cheap boards and easy waves the perfect combination to catch that first wave. There are several small surf schools set up along the beach. Alternatively, probably the best place to learn to surf in Sri Lanka is in nearby Weligama (10 mins). Built for surfers, there are hundreds of surf schools located right on the beach - just turn up, speak to a tout and you’ll be learning your way around a board just a few minutes later. A 1 - 1.5 hour lesson will teach you the basics of surfing including how to stand up, paddling for a wave, surfing etiquette, and safety. This is where we learned to surf, and somehow, we both managed to stand within our first five waves, and the thrill was incredible. The downside of learning to surf is of course, other learners. It can become super busy, especially during high season, so we suggest arriving early (at sunrise) to have the waves all to yourself. ENJOY THE BRUNCH SCENE Ahangama has a lot of, dare we say it, Bali vibes about it. Endless tropical-modernist eateries dot the coast and countryside, making it a bit of a foodie paradise. During our time there, we found an almost overwhelming number of hipster cafes and brunch spots filled with avo toast, smoothie bowls, and delicious coffee in abundance. These cafes are usually on the pricier side but well worth it. Housed in a delightfully airy garden hangout where staff whisk wooden platters filled with locally sourced vegetarian delights from kitchen to table, The Kip (open 8 am-3 pm daily) is the OG brunch cafe in Ahangama. Serving an all-day, locally sourced, and earth-friendly brunch, choose from 3, 4 or 5 pieces between breads, spreads, savoury, and sweets, accompanied by coffee, tea or a smoothie. Don’t sleep on the potato hash with leek, nor the smoothie bowl. The coffee is exceptional, maybe the best on the island. Cactus , overlooking dreamy Ahangama beach, is the popular, oft-full brunch hotspot that is the perfect place to start your day. There’s a great selection of savoury and sweet options - we chose the shroom bagel and fluffy chocolate pancakes - both delicious, and both recommended. The iced coffee, while not the best, is still better than most found on the island. Portions are super generous (you won’t leave hungry), and prices are a little higher than elsewhere, but for the view, it’s worth it. Palm Hotel might be a little away from the chaos of town, but it’s one of the most serene settings to enjoy a long, slow, brunch. And they do a damn good brunch at that. The traditional Sri Lankan breakfast; string hoppers, dhal and coconut sambol, is an absolute favourite of ours (we often prefer Sri Lankan breakfasts over Western), and the coconut milk rice with pomegranate was moreish. The coffee is good, and the iced milo is even better. Below are a few more brunch options in Ahangama: BLACK HONEY CAFE | Beautifully designed daytime café serving innovative breakfast fare and outstanding coffee in the backroads of Kabalana SISTERS AWAY | Must-vist brunch spot in Kabalana serving delicious home-baked bread by Turkish sister duo DREAMSEA | Smoothie bowls and avo-toast are favourites at this popular surf camp BROWSE AHANGAMA’S BOUTIQUES AND MARKETS The arrival of the bohemian surf set and their cool cafes and hotels in Ahangama has also heralded the pop up of many an equally cool boutique and market, perfect for satisfying any shopping cravings! From surf shops to slow-living boutiques, there’s no denying that a creative and entrepreneurial scene is flourishing along this stretch of coastline Some of our favourite options include: PRICKLY PEAR BOUTIQUE | This super tiny boutique attached to Cactus stocks a range of cool travel and surf essentials, from jewellery to Source + Supply journals, surfwear and tees to incense holders and plenty more. It’s also a nice place to spend a few minutes browsing in glorious air conditioning if the heat of the day is starting to wear you down! CEYLON SLIDERS | Weligama’s most famous restaurant and boutique has popped up here in Ahangama, bringing with it a gallery showcasing local photographers and artists and plenty of other hand-picked goods from the island and around the world. THE KIP BOUTIQUE | Once you’ve managed to roll yourself away from your brunch table at The Kip, head up the little garden path towards their boutique. As with their cafe, the focus here is honouring the abundance of local craft and skills in this part of the world, and their small, beautifully curated range of ceramics, linens, and homewares are locally sourced and supplied. CAFE CEYLON MARKETS | Cafe Ceylon’s surf shop runs all day onsite at their cafe, but they also run a monthly market supporting locally produced, sustainable brands, along with live music, workshops and food. Keep up to date with their event schedule here STUDIO MUKTI | An intentional and sustainable collection of jewellery, clothing, and homegoods made small-scale in Sri Lanka by local artisans ENJOY MANY SUNSET COCKTAILS Positioned perfectly for a daily dose of Sri Lanka’s famed golden sunsets, Ahangama Beach is filled with sunset bars offering exceptional cocktails, delicious small bites, excellent tunes, and some of the best vibes on the Island. Our favourite is Hotel de Uncle’s , a south coast offshoot of one of Colombo’s best bars. A ‘roti shop with a secret,’ this vibrant, funky bar is one of the hottest places in town, serving a range of local cocktails and classics with an ode to Island living. We spent a fantastic afternoon on the deck, listening to disco beats, sipping on pandan-fused cocktails and nibbling on a sumptuous dhal curry and cheese roti while watching the sunset. We suggest arriving early, grabbing a stool on the balcony, and settling in for a long night. Nearby, Weligama favourite Ceylon Sliders has opened their Ahangama offshoot, and it’s one of the more upscale bars we’ve been to on the island. Reminiscent of a hipster Canggu beachside bar, Ceylon Sliders serves excellent cocktails, even better food, and brilliant views of sunset. In the evening, local DJs play disco and funk, and the decking comes alive with beautiful people enjoying the end of the day. For food, we highly suggest the sesame-crusted tuna - it’s one of the best seafood meals we’ve ever had. Additionally, 2 for 1 cocktails are offered before 6 pm. Arrive early to grab a beachside table as they fill up very quickly. There are several other bars that dot the coastline from Kabalana Beach to Midigama, including the very popular Lighthouse, the laidback Abode by the Beach (more on that below), Hakuna Matata , and Thileni’s . Each has its appeal, depending on your vibe. If you’re in town for a few days, try them all. SPEND A DAY BY THE POOL AT PALM HOTEL If you’re looking to escape the sand and swells, but still want to relax by water, Palm Hotel has the most calming and sumptuous pool in which to spend a lazy afternoon. We were fortunate enough to stay at Palm for five nights, and there was nothing better than jumping into the pool and reading a book under the shade. Thankfully though, it’s not just reserved for guests - you can purchase a day pass and laze by the pool, sip cocktails, and snack on small bites. Gym access is also included in your day pass. It’s a 15-minute ride from town (LKR 1,200 by tuk tuk). THE DETAILS Where | Palm Hotel Ahangama Cost | LKR 7,000, deductible from food + drink. Free welcome drink included Note | Any tables/sun beds without a “reserved” sign are free game RIDE THE FAMOUS SOUTH COAST TRAIN A warm sea breeze wafts through the stifling carriage, taking with it the scent of the ocean and the heavy humidity. Swaying palms fly past in a blur, and the blue waters of the Indian Ocean seemingly lap just metres from the tracks. Inside, we manage to snag a seat alongside a local family and tuck into a still-warm samosa we bought at the station. The view outside is mesmerising; a kaleidoscope of colours, snapshots of daily life that flicker by in an instant. We sit for hours, eyes glued to the right, watching the world go by station by station, village by village, beach by beach, before arriving at the barrels and beach bars of Sri Lanka’s south coast. While not as popular as the Kandy to Ella train, riding the south coast train to Ahangama (and beyond) is one of the great travel experiences you can have. Whether it is a short trip from Unawatuna or a long ride from Colombo , we suggest making a train trip in Sri Lanka a priority - you can book your tickets for some Sri Lankan train journeys in advance here , or simply rock up and grab a ticket at the station. Additionally, the Art Deco stations along the south coast are some of the most picturesque in the country. Just remember to always sit ocean side. THE DETAILS What | Sri Lanka South Coast train BOOK | Buy Sri Lanka train tickets TAKE A DAY TRIP TO GALLE FORT Galle Fort is one of the unmissable points of interest on any Sri Lankan itinerary . The Fort is unlike any other place we’ve found in Sri Lanka; a mix of tumbledown colonia-era buildings and boho-chic getaways plonked in the delicious salty tropics. It’s a melting pot of culture and religion bursting with colour, and where, thankfully, the taste of Ceylon tea and cinnamon is never far away. The Fort is rapidly gentrifying as chic boutiques, cafes, and hotels begin to restore the whitewashed Dutch colonial buildings back to their former glory, but it only takes ducking down a quiet laneway to feel as though you’re somewhere else entirely Alluring, historic, and loveable, Galle Fort is one of our favourite places in Sri Lanka itinerary. There are a heap of must-sees (we've written a blog post about the best things to do in Galle Fort ) including: Galle Lighthouse Explore the exterior and interior of the Galle Fort, and visit the historical sights Shop till you drop.

Here are the best things to do in Jaffna, Sri Lanka, plus our short guide to the city including where to stay, eat, and how to get around! UPDATED - JULY 2024 “It’s.. different up there,” our tuk-tuk driver, Dilshan warned us as we puttered through the tea plantations just outside Ella . “The north, it doesn’t even feel like the same country,” he continued. “Actually, you might not even like it” We’d been chatting about our plans to head north to Jaffna - an area of Sri Lanka often skipped over by travellers to this little island paradise - and while thankfully Dilshan’s warnings about not liking it ended up being incorrect, he was definitely right about one thing: Jaffna. is. different. These northern realms of Sri Lanka drum to a beat of their own, led by the Tamils and a strong Hindu culture so entirely separate from the Sinhalese and Buddhist cultures of the south. Colourful Hindu temples dot the region, frequented by sari-clad women and shirtless men praying to the gods. The language is distinct, the people are more reserved, and the cuisine is influenced strongly by southern India. The region, finally rebuilding and healing after a bloody 26-year civil war that only ended in 2009, still bears the scars from this tumultuous period. More than 100,000 people are estimated to have been killed in the conflict, while today a few burnt-out homes and bullet-filled walls remain. For many, a deep pain and resentment towards the South and the outcome of the war is still felt. Yet despite it all, Jaffna is a seriously raw and authentic place to visit. We were blown away by the warmth of the locals, which although different to the south, is no less genuine. We also realised that, despite the lack of rope swings and insta-famous locations, Jaffna has an incredible amount of unique things to see and do, including ancient forts and temples, isolated islands, and truly amazing food. Dilshan was right, the north is very different, but we absolutely enjoyed it. The region’s still a while away from truly exploding as a tourism destination, but for those like us who are searching for an authentic travel experience, Jaffna is definitely a place we recommend you visit in Sri Lanka .

However, we did really enjoy walking its tourist-free walls and ramparts at our own pace and enjoying the great views over the moat, Jaffna Lagoon and the city. Similar to Galle, the Jaffna Fort was originally built by the Portuguese before the Dutch (and later, English) expanded it into one of the greatest forts in Asia in the late 1600s. This fort is much smaller in size than its counterpart so you can explore it easily in half a day. We’d recommend heading over in the afternoon to watch the sunset over the city. It's free to explore, although many historical buildings and structures remain in ruins due to the recent civil war. THE DETAILS Where | Jaffna Fort Cost | Free a different fort: the best things to do at sri lanka’s popular galle fort #2 ADMIRE THE COLOURFUL AND ANCIENT NALLUR KANDISWAMY HINDU TEMPLE Absolutely stunning; that's the only way we can describe the incredible Nallur Kandiswamy, a Hindu temple dedicated to Skanda/Murugan – the god of love, war and beauty. Just ten minutes from the centre of Jaffna town, Nallur Kandaswamy Kovil was first built as a fort in 948 when Nallur (“good city”) was an important ancient kingdom. Reconstructed twice (1450s and 1734), the towering golden-ochred temple has been calling faithful devotees to its grounds for centuries, becoming a significant landmark in Jaffna. From the minute we entered the grounds, this temple was unlike anything we’d ever seen before. From the men prostrating while praying to gods, to women in brightly coloured saris cracking coconuts as offerings to the gods, to the sounds of chanting and incense - it’s a truly fascinating, slightly chaotic cultural experience. Non-hindus are able to enter the temple, however do make sure you’re dressed appropriately. This means covered shoulders and legs for women, and shirts removed for men. Do not wear animal skin (e.g. leather) when entering the temple. If you’re travelling to Jaffna during August, be sure to visit Nallur Kandiswamy temple for the Nallur festival; a colourful month-long display of the vibrant Northern culture. THE DETAILS Where | Nallur Kandiswamy Hindu temple Cost | Free Tips | Dress appropriately. Women must cover their shoulders and legs, while men must remove their shirts. Photography is not allowed inside sri lanka travel tips | everything you need to know before you go #3 EMBRACE LOCAL LIFE AT JAFFNA MARKETS Visiting the local market of Thirunelveli was hands down our favourite thing to do in Jaffna. We arrived at 7 am to find the markets already thriving; a swirling cacophony of smells, colours and shouting that can only be found in a truly authentic local market. The presence of two foreigners definitely wasn’t unnoticed, and with many a curious stare pointed in our direction we initially felt like terribly intrusive outsiders. Gradually, a few friendly stall owners began to open up and embrace our presence and before long we were moving from stall to stall, chatting with sellers and learning about Jaffna, the markets, and their recent history. We took their portraits, tried local fruits, and were gifted many a coconut and generous smile. It was such a positive experience. After visiting Jaffna markets, we walked away feeling like we understood the people, culture and city so much more, and the whole experience made us really appreciate the north of Sri Lanka . If you do visit, please respect that Thirunelveli is a working market, so keep out of the way, try to buy some produce, and engage in friendly conversation. THE DETAILS Where | Thirunelveli Markets How to get there | It's easiest to catch a tuk-tuk, however if you're staying centrally, you can walk north along Palali Rd Cost | Free Tip | Visit early, at around 7am, when the markets are bustling and the golden light mesmerising sri lanka bucket list | 31 essential things to do in sri lanka #4 EXPLORE JAFFNA’S OUTER ISLAND, INCLUDING DELFT ISLAND Long, arduous, yet definitely satisfying - our day trip to Delft Island (Neduntheevu in Tamil, or Neduntivu in Sinhala) was certainly unique, and one of our favourite things to do in Jaffna. Located about 30 km from Jaffna city, Delft is an outlying coral and limestone island with a long history dating from the Chola Dynasty , Portuguese, Dutch and the British Colonial Period. It's absolutely not your stereotypical postcard-worthy island, but that's all part of its charm. Visiting the island was like stepping wayyyyy back in time, with tiny villages, windy dirt roads, rock walls, and swaying palms making up the island. Remnants of the Islands' past are dotted throughout, and we recommend visiting the following sites: Portuguese/Dutch Fort | Ruined ancient Fort, originally built by the Portuguese, and turned into a Fort by the Dutch Delft Island baobab tree | Huge baobab native to tropical Africa, left by Arab merchants Old Dutch Hospital | Built by the Dutch and converted into an administrative centre in the early 1900s. In 'The Courts', there's a British Emblem inscribed on the wall Pigeon Nest | A unique structure used to house messenger pigeons to other areas during the Dutch reign Dutch Horse Stables | Crumbling horse stables built during the Dutch occupation, housing horses from all over the world Food can be hard to come by on the Islands; there's one restaurant at the Jetty that serves vegetable roti and fried wade , otherwise, a few small markets sell the odd snack. We definitely recommend you bring at least 2L of water and enough food for the day. Delft Island was also the first time we've really noticed the effects of climate change - the whole Island was covered in water with the water table very high due to rising sea levels and recent unusual flooding. Scary. THE DETAILS Where | Delft Island (Neduntheevu or Neduntivu) How to get there | From Jaffna you need to get to Kurikadduwan Harbour, about an hour away. Take the 776 from the Jaffna bus station (LKR90 per person), departing at 6:30, or a tuk-tuk (LKR 2,000). The ferry for Delft leaves at 8 am or 9 am (LKR 100 per person), with a maximum number of 100 passengers, so it's important to get there 30 minutes before departure. Returning home, we recommend catching the 14:30 ferry back to Kurikadduwan harbour. How to get around Delft Island | Upon arrival, you can organise a tuk-tuk to take you to all the major sights. Expect to pay between LKR 1500 - 2500. Tip | Bring food and water just in case Read more | Our comprehensive Delft Island day trip guide sri lanka’s cultural capital | the best things to do in kandy #5 ROAD TRIP TO KEERIMALAI AND KANKESANTHURAI BEACH (KKS), NORTH OF JAFFNA We really wanted to get out of Jaffna city itself and explore the northern part of the city. Locals recommended a visit to Keerimalai and Kankesanthurai beaches (KKS), so we booked a tuk - tuk and set off. The north is dotted with colourful Hindi Kovils, spiritual abodes for local devotees and one which you must visit is Keerimalai Naguleswaram Kovil. Dating back 1000 years, the temple is dedicated to Shiva and is also located next to the Keerimalai pond which is said to have healing powers. We’re not sure about that latter part, but it is worth visiting to watch the local boys playing around. KKS beach is said to be the best in Jaffna, although in our honest opinion, we beg to differ. Although visually pretty enough, it was rather polluted when we were there, so it might be worth giving a miss if you're stretched for time. We did meet a number of local families, which made the experience enjoyable. If you're planning on heading north, ask your tuk-tuk driver to take you to the most important Kovil's in the area. THE DETAILS Where | Keerimalai and Kankesanthurai beach (KKS ) How to get there | Tuk tuk from Jaffna centre costs around LKR 2,000 - 2,500, including visiting major Kovils in the area. Alternatively, you can catch a local bus from Jaffna bus station to KKS, or the Yal Devi train service, leaving from Jaffna station beach days: our guide to unawatuna’s best things to do! #6 STROLL THROUGH JAFFNA’S LIVELY CITY CENTRE If you've got a spare afternoon, we definitely recommend strolling the streets of Jaffna and, dare we recommend it, getting a bit lost. Jaffna’s city centre is surprisingly beautiful - towering Palmyra palms, colourful Hindu temples, vibrant local markets, cute laneways, and of course, friendly smiles from surprised locals. The perfect way to see it all is on foot, through the centre of town. Starting at Jaffna bus station, head west and follow your nose. And when you're done grab a tuk-tuk to Mangos - the best restaurant in town! #7 EAT AT MANGO’S, JAFFNA’S BEST RESTAURANT At this very moment of writing, we're still dreaming about the masala dosa at Mangos, Jaffna's best (and most famous) restaurant. We were worried that this tourist-popular spot might not live up to the hype, but we can absolutely say that we had some of our best meals in Sri Lanka here. It was so good in fact, that we went back twice! The cuisine in Jaffna is very different to the southern reaches of Sri Lanka - think more South Indian in flavour, with heavier curries, biryani, dosas, and parathas. And Lassis... so many lassis! We recommend trying the signature masala dosa, the delicious onion bhaji, as well as any of the traditional south Indian curries, and washing it down with fresh pineapple juice (just remember to ask for no straw!). THE DETAILS Where | Mangos Indian Vegetarian Restaurant Cost | Masala Dosa: LKR 200, Pineapple juice: LKR 250 #8 GO ICE CREAM CRAZY AT RIO’S After finishing your masala dosa from Mangos, you probably won't be hungry. But if you have any space left and a craving for ice cream we’d suggest Rio’s a short walk away. Rio's is absolutely not your usual Italian gelato-style ice cream (so don’t go there expecting it!); it’s ice cream with a sweet South Indian twist, full of condiments and flavours to blow your mind. THE DETAILS Where | Rio’s Ice Cream Cafe Cost | Start from LRK 70 per sundae #9 ADMIRE THE COLONIAL REMNANTS AT JAFFNA PUBLIC LIBRARY AND JAFFNA CLOCK TOWER Unfortunately, Jaffna only has a small amount of colonial buildings still intact after the war. The two which we recommend you visit are Jaffna Public Library and Jaffna Clock Tower. Jaffna Public Library was actually one of the largest in Asia, containing over 97,000 books and manuscripts before it was burnt down in 1981 during the bloody civil war . In 2002 it was restored, although sadly the library collection is not what it once was. Visitors are only allowed into a few rooms, but it's still worth seeing. Just a short walk away is the Jaffna Clock Tower. Built in 1875 to commemorate the visit of Albert Edward, Prince of Wales to Ceylon , Jaffna Clock Tower is one of Jaffna's most famous attractions. THE DETAILS Where | Jaffna Public Library and Jaffna Clock Tower Opening hours | Jaffna Public Library - 4:30 pm - 6:30 pm for tourists experience the best of Ella | 10 essential things to do in ella #10 ENJOY SUNSET DRINKS AT JETWING JAFFNA As the sun sets over the Jaffna, the hazy skies turn bright orange before the speckled lights of the city illuminate. It's all very pretty, and perfect to be enjoyed with a cocktail or two. At least that's what we did! Jetwing Jaffna has the best views in town, overlooking the city and lagoon from their panoramic rooftop bar. Not only that, there's a happy hour during golden hour, allowing for (slightly) cheaper cocktails. We enjoyed a mojito and an ice-cold beer each, and we suggest you do, too. In addition to the rooftop bar, Jetwing Jaffna also houses one of Jaffna’s finest restaurants, called Peninsula. Serving authentic Jaffna and South Indian cuisine, such as the fiery red Jaffna crab curry and Odiyal Kool (a seafood broth). THE DETAILS Where | Jetwing Jaffna Opening hours | 11 am - 10 pm Cost | Cocktails start from LKR 1,000 #11 SPEAK WITH THE JAFFNA LOCALS We recommended speaking to locals in our Galle Fort guide , and we recommend the same in Jaffna. Why? Because almost everyone you see has lived through the bloody civil war that raged in this part of Sri Lanka for the better part of 25 years. These people have lived through a lot, and they all have stories to tell. Sure, people may not be immediately open about their experiences (and we don’t recommend you go in hard with questions about a painful war!), but if they do share, it can lead to many an intriguing, insightful, and at times, confronting conversation. When we mentioned Colombo to one shopkeeper, his face turned unexpectedly dark and he did a ‘slit the neck’ motion - clearly angry at a political coup that was currently playing out in the Sri Lankan government, where the president had been replaced by a leader with previously strong anti-Tamil sentiments. Others in the market were keen to share insights about the Tamil way of life, their culture and their experiences of life up north. They're also generally more than happy to tell you about all the amazing things to do in Jaffna, including where to eat (Mangos was suggested to us by a local, and that turned out very well!), so chat away and enjoy this unique culture.

WHERE TO STAY IN JAFFNA There are plenty of accommodation options available in Jaffna, although it’s worth noting that as the region is still opening up to tourism, accommodation up north tends to be a little more expensive than what you’ll find in the south of the country. The difference isn’t huge, but it’s definitely worth factoring into your budgeting/planning if you intend to make the trip up. A little note on accommodation in Sri Lanka: If you land expecting to see your traditional lively, dorm-room, rooftop-bar, communal-breakfast-area type hostels common to most of Southeast Asia on every corner, you may be left a little disappointed. We found there was actually a surprising lack of ‘hostel culture’ throughout the country, mostly because the accommodation centres around the family-run guesthouses listed below. As Jaffna slowly opens up, more and more hotels are becoming available (we spotted a number under construction on our travels there). There are some top-range hotels available, but most are mid-range yet comfortable. D’VILA GARDEN HOUSE | Our choice of accommodation was comfortable, quiet, and with lovely hosts.

Jaffna is the capital of the Jaffna district and is located on the northernmost peninsula of Sri Lanka. Distance-wise, it’s about 400km north of Colombo and 315km northwest of Kandy. HOW TO GET TO JAFFNA TRAIN Definitely the quickest and most scenic way to get from Colombo to Jaffna is via train, which runs through the heart of Sri Lanka via Anuradhapura. The Colombo Fort to Jaffna train departs 5 times a day, with the earliest departure at 05:45 am and the final departure at 20:30. You can pre-book your train tickets here , which we suggest you do as it books out very quickly. It takes around 7- 8 hours, and the busiest section is between Anuradhapura and Colombo (so be sure to have your seats sorted by then!). The journey also takes you past the infamous Elephant Pass , a slip of land connecting the Jaffna peninsula to the rest of Sri Lanka, which played a critical role in many battles throughout the Civil War. THE DETAILS Cost | LKR 600 per person for 2nd class, LKR 350 per person for 3rd class Departure Times | From Colombo Fort only: 0545, 0635, 0940, 1150, 2030 BOOK | Pre-book your train tickets from Colombo to Jaffna BUS It is possible to get from Colombo to Jaffna via an overnight bus, however, we recommend breaking up the journey by stopping in Kandy or Dambulla overnight. We took a local bus from Dambulla to Jaffna which took around 7 hours, and while it’s an easy trip to make, be warned that the the hard wooden seats can get uncomfortable after a while! This cost us 170r each. THE DETAILS Cost | LRK 400 - 500 per person WHEN IS THE BEST TIME TO VISIT JAFFNA, SRI LANKA We visited Jaffna in November and the weather was absolutely perfect, despite being known to be a wet month. The best time to visit is anytime between January - March, when little rain occurs and the temperatures are manageable (learn more on our Sri Lanka travel tips post). Do avoid April if possible, when the average temperature is 34 degrees - and have travelled to Sri Lanka in this month before, we can attest that it’s also a bajillion degrees of humidity! HOW LONG SHOULD YOU SPEND IN JAFFNA? Your travel style and length of stay in Sri Lanka will determine how long you wish to stay in Jaffna, however, we feel you can adequately experienc", "images":

From what to know before you visit, whether sunrise or sunset is better, and how to get to the top, this guide has you covered. UPDATED - July 2024 Often referred to as the eighth wonder of the world, Sigiriya is one of the 'must see' places on any Sri Lankan bucket list. Located right in the heart of Sri Lanka, Sigiriya, otherwise known as Lion Rock , is an ancient palace and fortress built in 480AD atop a unique rock island that rises 200m above the jungle below. The Fortress, full of abandoned palaces, gardens, waterways and frescoes, has always been an important part of Sri Lanka's history, and it has become one of the country’s most visited cultural heritage sites (read our guide to Sigiriya here ). While there's no doubting Sigiriya's astounding beauty, historical significance, and dramatic features, at USD 30pp, it can be a little expensive for those on a strict budget (ie. backpackers like us!). Fortunately, Pidurangala Rock, located adjacent to Sigiriya, provides equally epic views of the surrounding area, a historic cave complex of its own, a tenth of the crowds, and the most incredible view overlooking the famous Sigiriya rock. Hiking Pidurangala Rock for sunrise has become something of a right of passage for backpackers visiting Sri Lanka (follow our Sri Lanka itinerary) , and it was something we had to experience for ourselves (we’ve now done it twice, incidentally). After a quick, sweaty ascent to the peak, we stared in awe as the sun lit up the misty forests, lakes and villages, showering Sigiriya and the vast central Sri Lankan landscapes in golden hues. Core. Moment. Unlocked. As a result, we’re of the opinion that you can’t visit Sri Lanka without a visit to Pidurangala and Sigiriya. Explore Pidurangala Rock yourself with our complete guide, featuring all the tips you need to have a safe and incredible experience. LOVE OUR PHOTOS? Edit like us with our Tropical Dreams Preset Packs , and Tropical Bliss mobile video filters, inspired by the tropical beauty and colour of this beautiful country PIDURANGALA ROCK PLANNING GUIDE WHERE | Pidurangala Rock, central Sri Lanka HOW TO GET THERE | Book your transport here ENTRY FEE | LKR 1,000 HIKE LENGTH | 45 mins - 1 hour HIKE DIFFICULTY | Medium / Hard WHAT TO PACK | Water bottle (we use the Grayl), snacks, camera, rain gear WHERE TO STAY | Hotel Sigiriya , Lakmini Lodge or Back of Beyond Pidurangala EXPLORE BEYOND PIDURANGALA | Sigiriya, Dambulla Cave Temple, Kaudulla National Park, or Polonnaruwa historic site HIKING PIDURANGALA ROCK | ENTRY FEES, OPENING HOURS & WHEN TO VISIT PIDURANGALA ROCK ENTRANCE FEE & OPENING HOURS The Pidurangala Rock entrance fee is LKR 1,000 per person ($3 USD). The fee is part of a donation to the Pidurangala Sigiri Rajamaha Viharaya temple that you pass through to commence the hike. The Pidurangala Rock ticket office opens at 5 am and closes at 6 pm, but you’re welcome to stay as long as you like at the summit. While there's no doubting Sigiriya's astounding beauty, historical significance, and dramatic features, at USD 30pp, hiking Pidurangala Rock is a much more affordable option for those on a budget. THE DETAILS Cost | LKR 1,000 per person ($3 USD) Opening Hours | The Pidurangala Rock ticket office opens at 5 am and closes at 6 pm. These hours are not strictly enforced IS IT BEST TO VISIT PIDURANGALA FOR SUNRISE OR SUNSET? In our opinion, Pidurangala is best visited at sunrise. If you're a keen photographer looking to get some insta-fire, or want a truly magical Pidurangala experience overlooking Sigiriya , getting up before dawn and heading up to watch the sunrise over the surrounding landscapes is wonderful. Watch as the sun lights up the surrounding jungles, lakes and villages around Sigiriya and Pidurangala, showering the vast landscapes in golden hues. The feeling of peace from the top of Pidurangala during sunrise is palpable - silence is only broken by the chirp of birds, and the clatter of village life below. Also, you can always count on human laziness to guarantee that the crowds will be a fraction of their usual size this early in the morning too. For those of you who aren’t morning people, sunset is equally magical, yet a little busier. In the dry season, the fading light of sunset turns the surrounding area into a golden painting, with Sigiriya as the main subject. Watch as the sky chameleons itself into pale pastels and deep ochres over the valley. If you take your photography seriously , try to get there at least an hour before to grab your spot and set things up. WHEN IS THE BEST TIME OF YEAR TO VISIT PIDURANGALA ROCK? The best time of year to visit and hike Pidurangala is during the dry season, between late December and early April. For the best chance of a perfect sunrise or sunset, March is prime time, as there’s a limited chance of cloud cover. Do keep in mind that this is also the hottest part of the year, with temperatures and humidity exceedingly high, so always pack plenty of fluids. WEAR PROPER SHOES, BRING WATER The hike to Pidurangala Rock is not for the faint-hearted (more on that below), and, coupled with the Sri Lankan humidity and heat, can make this hike quite challenging for the unprepared. Here are a few items we recommend bringing on your Pidurangala hike: WATER | Bring your own water bottle for the hike (say NO to plastic, peeps!). We use the Grayl water purification bottles , which allows us to fill up from any water source, anywhere in the world HIKING BOOTS/PROPER SHOES | Although the hike isn’t too long, we definitely recommend wearing a pair of hiking boots, or some sneakers/trainers for the hike. CAMERA | The views at the top of Pidurangala are completely insta-worthy, so make sure you pack your camera to snap some bangers. We use the Sony A7RII SARONG | As the entry to Pidurangala is through a Buddhist temple, you’ll need to cover your shoulders and knees when passing through. To avoid any issues, bring a sarong/something to cover up with, or wear clothes that cover key areas HEADLAMP | If you’re hiking up for sunrise, or coming down after sunset, we recommend bringing a headlamp to guide the way read before you go | 39 essential sri lanka travel tips HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE TO CLIMB PIDURANGALA ROCK? This really depends on your level of fitness and desire to explore beyond the rock itself. Those with a reasonable level of fitness who are also stopping to look at things along the way should be able to complete the 500+ steps to the top in 45 minutes. However, do also factor in some decent extra time if hiking in the morning, as well as spending time at the summit. All in all, we’d recommend setting aside at least 3 hours for your visit. ACCESSIBILITY IS AN ISSUE The only way to the top of the Pidurangala is via a pretty tough 30 - 40 minute hike, ascending quickly over a rocky path, until a section of bouldering to get to the summit. In short, it’s unfortunately not very accessible. If you have issues with mobility, unfortunately this might be a spot you'll have to pass on. Fortunately, there are also plenty of amazing spots around Sigiriya to witness this 8th wonder of the world. HOW TO GET TO PIDURANGALA We recommend travelling to Sigiriya from Dambulla, mid-way between Kandy and the ancient rock fortress (and also home to the famous Dambulla Rock Temples). For a full Sri Lanka itinerary including both Dambulla and Sigiriya, don’t forget to check out our 3-week route guide! From Sigiriya, it’s a super easy tuk-tuk ride to the base of Pidurangala Rock, where you enter through Pidurangala Sigiri Rajamaha Viharaya temple ( map ). If you’re planning to visit for sunrise, we suggest planning ahead and organising a tuk-tuk to pick you up 1.5 hours before sunrise. We don’t recommend walking to the site as wild elephants roam the area, and an encounter with them is something best avoided. Alternatively, from Dambulla, you have two transport options: BY BUS | At the Dambulla Main Bus Station, take the regular bus service to Sigiriya (they run every 30 minutes between 6:45 am - 6:00 pm). The journey will take about an hour, and tickets should set you back at about LKR 100 per person, one way. The final bus stop is also just a 5-10-minute walk from the main ticket counter for Sigiriya Rock Fortress. BY TUK TUK | Alternatively, you can also grab a tuk-tuk in Dambulla for anywhere between LKR 600-1000 depending on how well you can (respectfully) negotiate your fare..! The tuk-tuk journey will take about 30 minutes, and is a good option for those basing themselves in Dambulla but who want to see Sigiriya (particularly for sunrise!). the best of sri lanka | our three-week sri lanka itinerary THE HISTORY OF PIDURANGALA ROCK Both Sigirya and Pidurangala Rock are volcanic hills rising out of the lowland jungles and central plains of Sri Lanka, and are steeped in history and mythology. Briefly, when King Kashyapa arrived in Sigiriya in the 5th century, he discovered Sigiriya itself was a monastery complex. Wanting to build a fortress atop Sigiriya for himself, he offered to build them an alternative, similar monastery at close by Pidurangala Rock. As the legend goes, King Kashyapa offered a ‘golden monastery’, or ‘Aran gala’, which would later become Pidurangala, which literally means \"offered piles of gold”. The monks duly obliged, and a Buddhist monastery was built in the caves and rocks around Pidurangala. Now, all that remains is the ancient cave temple and reclining Buddha which you pass on the way up, and a stupa near the temple entrance which is believed to mark the spot where King Kashyapa was cremated. So despite the epic insta-views, know that monks have been walking these very footpaths and enjoying the vistas for over 1,000 years! the ultimate guide to sigiriya: sri lanka’s palace in the clouds THE PIDURANGALA ROCK HIKE | OUR EXPERIENCE The hike to the top of Pidurangala is, to be blunt, taxing. Having now done the hike twice, it doesn’t get any easier, as the rapid ascent up many stairs leads to aching quads and calves. That being said, the views are unequivocally worth it. The hike to Pidurangala takes around 30 - 45 minutes, depending on your fitness level. START It starts at Pidurangala Sigiri Rajamaha Viharaya ( map ), a white temple at the base of the rock. Here, you’ll need to pay your entrance fee (LKR 500 / $3 USD) before the first of the seemingly endless stairs start (also, it’s a temple, so you’ll need to cover up). The trail itself follows a well-maintained, if slightly ‘off-road’ pathway through the jungle, slowly ascending over rocks and tree roots, through caves, and past rocky cliffs before making its way to the first stop on the hike, Pidurangala temple. If you’re hiking up for sunrise, we suggest stopping by the ruins of Pudurangala Temple on the return journey, as sunrise should be fast approaching. MIDDLE The next part of the hike is somewhat tricky but seriously fun. From the temple, it’s about a 15-minute hike which requires a decent amount of bouldering, climbing and shimmying between giant boulders and cliffs. It’s not necessarily a hike at this point, more a European style via Ferrata, but in the heart of Sri Lanka. While it’s not overly hard to pass through this point, we do recommend taking your time to avoid any injuries, especially if hiking in the dark. SUMMIT After a few large steps, you’ll tackle one final lunge to get onto the main part of Pidurangala rock, before a small walk up to witness the panoramic views you’ve been waiting to see. island paradise | 31 incredible things to do in Sri Lanka THE VIEWS FROM PIDURANGALA The 360° views from the summit of Pidurangala will blow you away - there’s simply no better view in all of Sri Lanka, especially during sunrise or sunset. To the south lies Sigiriya , where the best views are head. Facing Sigiriya, turn right and move down the rock face a little for the clearest views, framed by the jungles below. The majority of the summit is a curved rock which allows for plenty of exploration, so don’t be afraid to take in the scenery from all angles, including over Minneraya and Kaudulla National Parks to the west. the ultimate sri lanka travel guide | exactly what to see, know, and do PIDURANGALA ROCK TEMPLE On the way down from Pidurangala (or on the way up, if you’re hiking up for sunset), you’ll come across the ancient remains of Pidurangala Temple. While not much remains, the most impressive sight is a 12m reclining Buddha which takes pride of place under a rock face. arts of the original structure remain intact, while the rest has been reconstructed using bricks, including the head, which was removed by treasure hunters. Interestingly, the reclining Buddha statue actually faces directly to the Lion’s Paw of Sigiriya. There is also a 7th-century rock inscription of ‘pidu’, ‘ran’, and good’, literally translated as \"offered piles of gold”. WHERE TO STAY AT PIDURANGALA OR SIGIRIYA HOTEL SIGIRIYA One of Sigiriya’s premiere hotels, Hotel Sigiriya offers five-star luxury overlooking the iconic Sigiriya Rock Fortress. The rooms are large, modern and comfortable, and the on-site restaurant is top-notch, however, the hotel’s key feature is the stunning pool overlooking the fortress. If you’re looking to splash out, you can’t go past Hotel Sigiriya. BOOK | Hotel Sigiriya LAKMINI LODGE Where we stayed during our 2023 trip to Sigiriya, Lakmini Lodge is minimal, modern, and affordable. Run by the most lovely local family, the hotel features spacious rooms, a wonderful breakfast, and a rooftop that offers exceptional views over Sigirya. It’s also well located, close to local restaurants, and within a short tuk-tuk ride to the Sigiriya entry. BOOK | Lakmini Lodge BACK OF BEYOND TREEHOUSE We stayed in a treehouse at Back of Beyond Pidurangala (check their website here ), a sustainable eco-lodge in the heart of the national park and only a two-minute walk from the beginning of the Pidurangala hike. We recommend staying here if you’re looking for a unique experience in the Sigiriya/Pidurangala area! BOOK | Back of Beyond Pidurangala HOSTEL Alternatively, for those on a strict budget, One Night Hostel is a good option. Located around 1km to Sigiriya, and 2km to Pidurangala, it’s a super central location. Standard 6-bed dorms (which are air-conditioned!) will cost around LKR 1,500 ($8 USD per night). BOOK | One Night Hostel Sigiriya Sri lanka’s famous train ride | read our kandy to ella train RESPONSIBLE TRAVEL AT PIDURANGALA Before hiking Pidurangala, make sure to take these simple measures to make your visit as responsible and sustainable as possible. REUSABLE WATER BOTTLE | Plastic is not allowed at Pidurangala (although this is unfortunately loosely enforced), so bring your own water bottle for the hike. We use the Grayl water purification bottles , which allow us to fill up from any water source, anywhere in the world (including train taps!). It’s the best investment we’ve ever made! DRESS CODE | In Sri Lanka, a fairly strict dress code applies when visiting sights of religious significance, such as temples or stupas. Cover your shoulders and knees when passing through the temple before your hike. This applies to passing through the Pidurangala Sigiri Rajamaha Viharaya temple, where you’ll need to remove your shoes before entering. DON’T LITTER | Unfortunately, there’s a mountain of plastic at the summit of Pidurangala. If you do take plastic with you on the hike (which, you shouldn’t!), remember to take it with you and dispose of it later. Keep Pidurangala pristine for the next visitor DON’T TAKE ELEPHANT RIDES | Thankfully, elephant safaris aren’t a thing at either the actual Sigiriya or Pidurangala attractions - but they do still operate through the surrounding town. We witnessed several tourists taking elephant rides which was disappointing to see in 2019, that’s for sure. If you don’t know why it’s unethical, read our guide to animal-friendly travel here READ | Our top responsible travel tips , 39 essential Sri Lanka travel tips THINGS TO DO AROUND PIDURANGALA | DAY TRIPS FROM SIGIRIYA Sigiriya forms one point of the so-called Sri Lankan ‘cultural triangle’ of Dambulla and Polonnaruwa, and both are worth making visits to whilst you’re in the area. Here are our recommendations for further explorations around Sigiriya: EXPLORE THE ANCIENT ROCK FORTRESS OF SIGIRIYA If you’re a backpacker visiting Pidurangala, you might have decided to give Sigiriya a miss… but we urge you to reconsider. It may be expensive, but it’s one of the wonders of the world, and Sri Lanka’s most iconic attraction - a visit to the country wouldn’t be worthwhile without actually stepping on top of Sigiriya and admiring the views far and wide (read our guide to Sigiriya here ). THE DETAILS Where | Sigiriya, Sri Lanka Cost | USD $36pp for entry to Sigiriya READ | Our complete guide to Sigiriya , Sri Lanka’s rock fortress wonder POLONNARUWA Just an hour away from Sigiriya by tuk-tuk, the ruined city of Polonnaruwa was once the powerful capital of ancient Sri Lanka. Built between the 10th and 12th centuries, this was the thriving commercial and religious epicentre of the country. Today, the ruins of many temples, palaces, and religious buildings can be explored and the ancient site is vaguely reminiscent of the Angkor temples of Cambodia, just not as grand or well preserved. That being said, the site is still wonderful to explore. Our visit coincided with the hottest month, April, so exploring the site was tough due to the oppressive heat. We actually hired a tuk-tuk to drive us in between the best spot (which, if you've explored Sri Lanka in April heat, you’ll understand!), which made exploring mildly possible. Alternatively, the best way to explore the Polonnaruwa complex is via bike. THE DETAILS Where | Polonnaruwa Cost | Polonnaruwa entry: LKR 3,750 Recommended tours | Polonnaruwa + Mineriya day tour from Dambulla , Polonnaruwa day trip from Colombo DAMBULLA ROCK CAVE TEMPLE We’d probably recommend making the trip to Dambulla Rock Cave Temple on your way to or from Sigiriya, considering Dambulla is the entry/exit point of most adventures to the rock fortress. The UNESCO World Heritage Royal rock temple complex of Dambulla is home to some of the most impressive historical artwork in Sri Lanka, and a must-see on any Sri Lankan itinerary. There are five separate caves with over 150 Buddhist statues and paintings, some dating back over 2,000 years. Murals cover over 2,100 square metres of cave walls, depicting Buddha’s life, while the views overlooking the surrounding valley, (with Sigiriya in the distance!) are just beautiful.

Over 200 elephants call the park home, along with a scattering of crocodiles, monkeys, and a few shy leopards. The advantage of Kaudulla is that it can be visited year-round (Sri Lanka’s other famous parks close depending on the season) — so you are pretty much guaranteed an elephant encounter on your Sri Lanka travels should you end up coming here. Safaris are generally half-day, can be taken in the morning or afternoon, and include pick-up from your accommodation in Sigirya or Dambulla. Book here .

Brilliant decision! Here's everything you need to know, including our essential travel (and food!) tips, visa requirements, health and safety, and history. UPDATED - JULY 2024 Ask us both what our top 3 countries are, and Sri Lanka makes the list every. single. time. I mean, how could we not love it?! From the turquoise coastlines to its lush green heart , the insanely welcoming nature of the locals to some of the greatest food your tastebuds are likely to ever enjoy, this culture-rich bite-sized Utopia in the Indian Ocean is a true traveller’s paradise. There’s absolutely a reason it’s now enjoying its moment in the sun as the ‘it’ travel destination! After four trips to Sri Lanka over the last couple of years, there are a few things we’ve learned along the way, along with travel tips we wish we’d known before we arrived at Colombo airport for the first time. If you’re planning your travels there sometime soon, we’ve put together this list of Sri Lanka travel tips we think you should know before you visit. You know, the good and simple stuff, that will help you travel better and more responsibly in the teardrop Isle. LOVE OUR PHOTOS? Edit like us with our Tropical Dreams Preset Packs , and Tropical Bliss mobile video filters, inspired by the tropical beauty and colour of this beautiful country SRI LANKA TRAVEL TIPS | GENERAL THINGS TO KNOW #1 IT’S AN INCREDIBLY FRIENDLY COUNTRY Long after your holiday tan has faded and the spices are no longer tickling your nose and mouth, the thing that will stick with you most about Sri Lanka will be how friendly the locals are. In many ways, ‘friendly’ doesn’t even begin to describe how warm, genuinely kind, and generous Sri Lankan people are. As travellers, often our default mode is (sadly) to be cautious or guarded when someone approaches you to ‘chat’, as so often this is the gateway to an attempted sale or scam. But here, we were constantly caught off-guard by their radiant smiles, a genuine desire to chat, to learn about each other’s cultures, or simply to help out someone who clearly wasn’t from around these parts. We’ve had tuk-tuk drivers surprise us with coconuts on long drives, fellow passengers help us manoeuvre our bags (and selves) into safer positions on overcrowded trains, families welcome us into their homes for tea and a chat, and people go out of their way time and time again, of their own accord, to make sure we felt welcome. It’s a pretty special thing to experience, and it’s one of the reasons we love Sri Lanka so dearly. #2 SRI LANKA IS FAR MORE DEVELOPED THAN YOU THINK What many people don’t realise about Sri Lanka is that its small geographical size and huge population make it a great testing ground for new technologies. From hybrid cars to 4G networks and general infrastructure, the country is far more developed than most travellers generally assume when they first arrive. Tech entrepreneurship is also thriving here, with apps like PickMe (tuktuks) and Yoho Bed (accommodation) changing the way you can travel around the island. #3 IT’S CHANGING RAPIDLY, SO VISIT NOW Mostly due to the civil war , Sri Lanka had remained very much under the tourism radar for a long time, but that’s all about to change. This is a country on the brink of a tourism boom, and we actually noticed a huge shift in tourism from our first trip in early 2016 to our second in late 2018. Sleepy coastal towns have morphed into backpacker hotspots, ‘Instagram spots’ are a thing now, and these days there are plenty of travellers on streets where we saw none before. Now that Lonely Planet has named Sri Lanka as its top travel destination for 2019 - not to mention the Chinese-led development of a second major metropolis being built on reclaimed land in Colombo - expect that change will arrive even quicker for this beautiful island nation. So get there soon! hill-country dreaming: all the best things to do in ella, sri lanka #4 DON’T LET ITS SIZE FOOL YOU, THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS TO DO IN SRI LANKA For an island roughly the tiny size of Ireland, Sri Lanka packs a serious punch when it comes to the diversity of things to see and do ( which you can read all about here ). Endless golden beaches with pumping surf ring the island’s lush, jungle-clad heart ; bustling cities full of colour and spice give way to hidden palm-fringed alcoves; timeless World Heritage sites dot all corners of the island, while Elephants and Leopards still roam national parks in abundance. Then, there are the wonderfully friendly locals, the picturesque train rides, the tastiest cuisine you could gift your tastebuds with, and more than one vibrant and fascinating culture steeped in ancient history and tradition. It’s the kind of diversity entire continents dream of, and all packed into one small island in the Indian Ocean. Utopia, plain and simple. #5 IT’S PRETTY AFFORDABLE, BUT MORE EXPENSIVE THAN OTHER SOUTH ASIAN COUNTRIES In our experience, Sri Lanka is a pretty affordable travel destination, but it’s pricier when you compare it with many of its neighbours . Food and transport is particularly cheap here, with our longest train ride ( Jaffna to Colombo) only setting us back £1.47 each, and most local meals coming in between £1-3 per person. The real budget breakers here are accommodation which we found to be pretty pricey on both trips, with private rooms in guesthouses priced at about £15-25 per night, meals in the trendy cafes and restaurants dotting the southern coast (obviously!), and paying for guided tours, like safaris. Again, compared to western pricing it’s still very much a budget destination, but for those travelling on a backpacker budget, it’s something to be aware of. #6 LOCAL DATA IS SUPER CHEAP (AND RELIABLE) On our most recent trip to Sri Lanka , we actually ended up just using our 3 UK sim cards (thank you, ‘Go Roam’ coverage!), but during our first trip in 2016, we bought local sim cards and topped up with data as we needed. 4G is readily available here, and actually seems to enjoy a better signal than we used to get living in London! Better yet, buying pay-as-you-go credit is super cheap. Dialog has free sim cards available to travellers at the airport, and LKR 1300 (USD $9) will get you 9GB of data and LKR 350 of local calls. To top up, simply head to any little convenience shop. #7 ENGLISH IS WIDELY SPOKEN We’ve never had any trouble communicating while travelling through Sri Lanka, as almost everyone has at least a basic level of English, particularly as it’s also their third official language. Alternatively, if the person you’re speaking with doesn’t understand you, they’ll likely go out of their way to help you find someone who does speak English, so don’t stress! #8 SRI LANKA ISN’T A PARTY PLACE If it’s thumping beats, free-flowing booze and a crazy party scene you seek, Koh Phangan or Goa may be more your thing. In stark contrast to many of its Asian neighbours, there really isn’t much in the way of nightlife in Sri Lanka, particularly outside of Colombo or a few of the busier southern beach areas ( Unawatuna or Hikkaduwa, for example). In fact, raucous public drinking is pretty frowned upon here, and most of the local life revolves around quiet evenings and early starts, so try to limit your rowdiness where possible. However, in recent years, the parties have started to ramp up, especially in bohemian hotspots such as Ahangama and Hiriketiya. It’s still a more relaxed party vibe than say, Ibiza - think barefoot jungle trance events, and jazz marathons in former Art Deco mansions, but they’re slowly but surely growing on the island. So, if you’re keen on a relaxed boogie, Ahangama and Hiri are your best bet. Just remember to not be a dickhead. #9 THERE ISN’T REALLY A HOSTEL CULTURE; STAY IN FAMILY-RUN GUESTHOUSES INSTEAD Don’t expect to see your stock standard lively, dorm-room, rooftop-bar, communal-breakfast-area type hostels that are common to the rest of Asia here - there’s actually a surprising lack of hostel culture throughout the country. This is mostly down to the developing nature of tourism here, but also due to the fact that outside of Colombo, accommodation generally centres around family-run guesthouses. We actually prefer this when travelling here anyway, as Sri Lankans are absolutely some of the kindest, most hospitable people on the planet and every single one of our hosts went out of their way to make us feel comfortable throughout our stay. Plus, when you stay in locally and family-owned accommodation, you support and empower communities directly. We found all of our guesthouse accommodation super easily by either searching booking.com , or simply turning up and asking a local where to stay!

Beautiful beaches, insanely cheap prices for both lessons and board rental and plenty of expert local surfers and schools around to help guide you to becoming a surfing pro make this one of the world’s best learn-to-surf destinations. The best place to try your luck surfing is Weligama on the southern coastline (2 hours from Colombo, 30 minutes from Unawatuna ), where hundreds of surf schools dot the beach, or the horseshoe bay of Hiriketiya . We booked with Freedom Surf , and a 1 - 1.5 hour lesson costs LKR 2,500 per person. You’ll cover the basics, including how to stand up, paddling for a wave, surfing etiquette, and safety. Somehow, we both managed to stand within our first five waves, and the thrill was incredible. We're now 100% converted to surfing. Other places you can learn to surf on the south and east coast, include Unawatuna , Ahangama, and Arugam Bay. #11 THERE ARE TWO MONSOON PERIODS IN SRI LANKA Unusually for an island of its size, Sri Lanka experiences not just one, but two monsoon periods each year, affecting opposite sides of the island and alternate times of the year. Obviously, for travellers looking to see the most with as little rain as possible, this means a slightly more complicated itinerary-planning mission. The good news is though, that these rainy seasons are generally short, and sunshine and good beach weather can always be found somewhere on the island. The main southwest monsoon, ‘Yala’, brings heavy wind and intense rains to the west (Colombo, Negombo, Kalpitiya), hill country ( Kandy , Nuwara Eliya, Ella , Haputale, Adam’s Peak), and southwest coastlines ( Galle , Mirissa, Unawatuna , Tangalle, Yala National Park ) from April/May through to August. This tends to be the largest monsoon period on the island. Needless to say, peak travel season through these parts is during the dry season, from October to April. The second monsoon, ‘Maha’, hits the east coast and northern regions (Trincomalee, Arugam Bay, Nilaveli, Jaffna ) between October and February. By all accounts, much of the action shut down over this time, so you’ll be hard-pressed to find much in the way of accommodation, restaurants, etc open. Depending on how long you have for your trip, you might want to focus on one side of the island to avoid crappy weather in others. If you’re keen to see as much as possible across the entire island, we’d recommend December - March, as it tends to be the driest across the country, including in the cultural triangle ( Sigiriya / Pidurangala , Anuradhapura). We’ve travelled in both April (sweltering and wet!), and November (lovely), and definitely recommend the latter. #12 IT’S BLOODY HOT, SO BE PREPARED One thing that remains constant in Sri Lanka’s weather patterns is that it’s pretty generally hot, all year round. Average temperatures island-wide range between 26-30c most months, and the humidity is intense beyond words. In fact, on our first trip to the island in April 2016 (which we later discovered tends to be the hottest month!), we found we had to get most of our sightseeing done before 10 am when the heat of the day became almost unbearable. Be prepared; pack lots of light, loose-fitting clothing, sunscreen, sunglasses, and a hat, and always carry a full reusable water bottle - you’re going to need it! the best things to do in galle fort , sri lanka’s historic seaside fortress HISTORY & CULTURE TIPS FOR SRI LANKA #13 SRI LANKA HAS A DIVERSE AND ANCIENT HISTORY Ancient kingdoms, multiple colonial heritages, and a civil war: Sri Lanka’s history is fascinatingly diverse and complex. For thousands of years, this tiny fertile island was an important trading hub along the Silk Road route, the woody spice of its native cinnamon bark desired the world over. The immense power of the nation’s ancient Kingdoms can still be seen today, in the many UNESCO-protected ruins (Polonnoruwa, Sigiriya , and Anuradhapura) that dot the so-called cultural triangle of the centre of the country. In the 1500s, the first colonisers invaded; first, the Portuguese, then the Dutch, and eventually the British, bringing their religion and social class systems, extensive Fortifications and architecture - many of which can still be found today (particularly in Galle ). Colonial rule lasted almost 450 years until Sri Lanka was finally granted their independence in 1948. Then came the fierce and bloody civil war, a drawn-out 25-year battle for independence by the Tamil Tigers of the north, from which the country has been trying to rebuild since 2009. It’s this diversity of Sri Lanka’s heritage that makes it such a fascinating destination for those seeking a cultural, and historical experience on their travels. #14 SRI LANKA IS STILL EMERGING FROM A DECADES-LONG CIVIL WAR For more than 25 long, bloody years between 1983 and 2009, Sri Lanka tore itself apart from the inside out during a brutal civil war between the Sinhalese majority and the Tamil minority. The war’s origins are complex and varied (read the full history here ), but in short, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam fought desperately for the creation of an independent Tamil state. While many violent attacks occurred all over the country, the majority of the battle raged in Sri Lanka’s predominantly Tamil north, and more than 80,000 (mostly civilian) lives were lost during the conflict. Today, both sides live relatively peacefully as they continue to rebuild and heal. But while the fighting may be over, the pain of that time still runs deep - particularly in Jaffna , where bullet-ridden, bombed-out buildings and fields full of landmines still scar the landscape - so tread carefully when raising it in conversation with locals. #15 THE NORTH IS VERY DIFFERENT TO THE SOUTH - BUT IT’S ABSOLUTELY WORTH YOUR VISIT Before we travelled to Jaffna and Sri Lanka’s northern reaches, we’d been warned that it totally was different to the rest of the country, and it’s true. These northern realms of Sri Lanka drum to a beat entirely different to that of the south, led by the predominantly Tamil population with their strong Hindu culture. Here, colourful Hindu temples dot the region, frequented by brightly sari-clad women and shirtless men praying to the gods. The language, Tamil, is distinct from the Sinhalese spoken down south, the people less effusive and more guarded, and the cuisine influenced strongly by southern India, less than 100km from its coastline. This was the epicentre of the bloody civil war, which raged here until 2009 and killed thousands of people. Today, though the region is rebuilding and healing slowly, the scars of the war can still be felt deeply in the burnt-out homes and bullet-filled walls that remain. For many up here, the war is not over, and there’s still some lingering resentment towards the South. Despite this, Jaffna is a seriously raw and authentic place to visit, and we were blown away by the warmth of the locals. It might be world’s away from the south, but it’s no less worthy of your visit. To understand modern Sri Lanka, you need to understand its tragic past - and this is the very place to do so.

What’s more, we were about to hike up to Adam’s Peak, the most sacred religious monument in Sri Lanka, on New Years’ Eve! Over the 13th - 15th of April every year, as the sun moves from the Meena Rashiya (House of Pisces) to the Mesha Rashiya (House of Aries), Sri Lankans welcome in a brand new year with a bucketload of firecrackers, colourful fireworks, and lots of traditional sweet treats. It’s a wonderful, lively time to be in Sri Lanka, except for travellers it means one thing: the entire country basically grinds to a halt. Families travel from one side of the country to the other as they go home to visit their families, shops, restaurants, and attractions close, and hotels book up weeks before the celebrations begin. The transport network is heaving beyond any comprehension, making travel between destinations difficult - we couldn’t actually physically get onto our train in Hatton, for example!) - and unless your hotel or guesthouse has confirmed they’re serving food, you may struggle to find it. If possible, settle into one destination (and the celebrations!) during this time, and make sure your hotel is serving food. Trying to travel on either the 13th or 15th of the month is absolute bedlam! #17 LEAVE THE BUDDHA T-SHIRTS AT HOME AND COVER UP YOUR BUDDHA TATTOOS As you’d expect from a majority Buddhist country, Buddha is a deeply revered religious figure here. Showing off tattoos or clothing that shows depictions is not just disrespectful here, it can actually get you arrested and deported here. That’s not a gross overstatement either; in 2012 singer Akon was banned from entering the country thanks to a music video showing people partying in front of a Buddha statue. In both 2013 and 2014, British tourists were deported for sporting Buddha tattoos on their arms, and in 2017 an Indian woman was detained for wearing a t-shirt with Buddha on the front. #18 DON’T TAKE PHOTOS WITH YOUR BACK TO BUDDHA Never stand with your back to Buddha, and absolutely never take a photo with your back to Buddha either. If seen, you’ll be asked to delete the images by security. Likewise, don’t touch, kiss, or ‘interact’ with depictions of Buddha either - like the French tourists who posted themselves kissing Buddha statues and found themselves with a suspended hard labour sentence. If you do want to take a photo with a statue, make sure everyone in the shot is facing Buddha. #19 THE CULTURE IS PRETTY CONSERVATIVE - SO DRESS AND BEHAVE APPROPRIATELY If you scroll the Sri Lanka hashtag on Instagram, you’d be forgiven for thinking this was a land of bikinis, short shorts and singlets - but it’s definitely not the case. Sri Lankans are majority Buddhist or Hindu, and their culture is built upon modesty, politeness, and conservative behaviour and dress, which means excessive drinking, PDAs, loud or brash behaviour, and skimpy clothing really are frowned upon. In the touristy coastal areas, you can get away with bikinis and shorts on the beach, but please cover up as you move further into town. In Colombo, it’s below knees and covered shoulders as the rule. #20 ALWAYS PACK A SARONG IN YOUR DAY PACK The humble sarong, or in our case, Turkish towel, is probably the most versatile item in our backpack. In seconds, it can trans", "images": ["https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5a3bb03b4c326d76de73ddaa/aea2515c-a3b2-417a-a021-994dfe9e090b/The_Common_Wanderer_-1071.jpg",

From its troubled history to current safety advice, how to visit respectfully and where to eat, these are the things to know before you visit Jaffna. UPDATED - JANUARY 2024 If you’re planning on making the journey north to Jaffna on your Sri Lankan adventure (which we certainly hope you do!), get ready for a fascinating insight to a beautiful, culturally diverse part of the country. Only just opening up to visitors again and once the epicentre of Sri Lanka’s fiercely-waged and bloody civil war battle, these northern reaches are still considered pretty ‘off the beaten track’ compared to the Instagram-popular rope swing beaches and safari plains found in the country’s south. In fact, we’ve encountered a few travellers who seem reluctant to head north and explore this unique, culturally diverse part of the country. We’re here to tell you that while Jaffna is very different to its southern counterparts — led by its Tamil population and a strong Hindu culture world’s apart from the Buddhist Sinhalese down south — it’s absolutely no less worthy of your visit. We’ve already put together a Jaffna travel guide with all our favourite things to do there (along with some suggestions on where to stay and eat!), but to really get the most out of your Jaffna trip, there are a few things to know about Jaffna that we feel are essential for every traveller making the journey north. From the region’s recent troubled history to today’s safety advice, navigating cultural differences to all your transport needs, plus how to make the most of your time there, these are the things to know before you visit Jaffna.

It’s very quiet and a little bit like India”. Unsurprisingly, they were right. Jaffna IS different. Hugely, so. Led by the predominantly Tamil population with their strong Hindu culture, Jaffna and the north is full of colourful Hindu temples, frequented by brightly sari-clad women and shirtless men praying to the gods. The cuisine is influenced strongly by southern India, less than 100km from its coastline. Local delicacies in Jaffna include Dosas, fish curries and thali. It’s bloody delicious though, something Jaffna does have in common with the rest of Sri Lanka. The common language in Jaffna is Tamil, and the distinctive curved alphabet of Sinhalese replaced with the more angular Tamil on street signs, menus and storefronts. Despite the differences, Jaffna is a seriously raw and authentic place to visit, and we were blown away by the warmth of the locals. It might be world’s away from the south, but it’s no less worthy of your visit. READ | Our full guide to Jaffna and the north here ﻿ #2 JAFFNA HISTORY | THE HISTORICAL CONTEXT Jaffna has a complicated past, most obviously at the forefront of a decades-long bloody civil war that claimed the lives of more than 80,000 civilians. To understand Jaffna now, it’s really important to understand its historical context too. It all started back in the 40s when Independence from colonial rule was obtained . At the time, a controversial law was passed by the Ceylon Parliament called the Ceylon Citizenship Act, which discriminated against the Indian Tamil ethnic minority. Essentially, the minority Tamils were not granted citizenship in the country and over 700,000 Indian Tamils were made stateless . There were deportations of Indian Tamils, whilst Sri Lankan Tamils were discriminated against at a cultural, religious, linguistic and economic level while the Ceylon Government actively promoted a ’Sinhala only’ mandate. The Tamil Tigers (Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam) were eventually formed, fighting for a separate Hindu/Tamil state in the north and east of Sri Lanka called Tamil Eelam. In July 1983, the LTTE ambushed a Sri Lankan army patrol outside the town of Thirunelveli, killing an officer and 12 soldiers. The Government retaliated, massacring between 400–3,000 Tamils. This is considered the beginning of the civil war , and for more than 25 long, bloody years between 1983 and 2009, Sri Lanka tore itself apart from the inside out . The majority of the battle raged in Sri Lanka’s predominantly Tamil north, and more than 80,000 (mostly civilian) lives were lost during the conflict. In May 2009, the Sri Lankan Army declared victory and the bloody war ended. In the aftermath, then President Mahinda Rajapaksa announced that the government was committed to a political solution and the Pro-LTTE political party Tamil National Alliance (TNA), the largest political group representing the Sri Lankan Tamil community, dropped its demand for a separate state, in favour of a federal solution. While the fighting may be over and both sides live in relative peace, the pain of that time still runs deep - particularly in Jaffna , where bullet-ridden, bombed-out buildings and fields full of landmines still scar the landscape. For many people in Jaffna, the war is not over, and there’s still some lingering resentment towards the South. trip planning essentials | our essential sri lanka travel tips #3 THERE’S STILL RESENTMENT TOWARDS THE SOUTH While the civil war ended 10 years ago, resentment towards the Sinhalese Government and the south remains . Everyone you see has probably had at least one family member in LTTE, and almost everyone knows someone who perished in the war. There’s still a strong military and police presence throughout the region (although this doesn’t affect tourists in any way). To many Tamils, the military presence reminds them of the past, and what the state was/is capable of. Indeed, when we mentioned catching the train back to Colombo to one shopkeeper, his face turned unexpectedly dark and he made a ‘slit the neck’ motion - clearly angry at a political coup that was currently playing out in the Sri Lankan government, where the president had been replaced by a leader with previously strong anti-Tamil sentiments. For the Sinhalese, the military presence is to control any future uprisings, but the continued presence does little to build trust amongst the locals looking towards the future. #4 BUT NOW IS THE TIME TO VISIT JAFFNA… We kinda feel like now is the best time to visit Jaffna. The war is over and investment is flooding in; new hotels and restaurants are opening all the time, and a shiny new train is bringing visitors further north than they have ventured in decades. Tourism provides a huge opportunity to Jaffna to start to rebuild and improve the economic prosperity in the region. Fortunately, progress is marching forward and one day this part of the country may look much like the rest of it; well-trodden tourist trails lined with backpacker hostels and smoothie shops. But for now, the north is as wild and unexplored as it gets on this tropical paradise and perfect for intrepid travellers to find off-the-beaten-track sites and hidden treasures. So, VISIT NOW! #5 THERE’S A HEAP OF INTERESTING THINGS TO SEE AND DO IN JAFFNA, YOU JUST NEED TO LOOK HARDER While the south of Sri Lanka might be filled with amazing things to do and places to visit, you’ll have to look a little harder for Jaffna’s top attractions. And they’re not exactly iconic or noteworthy, but that makes this part of Sri Lanka unique. While we’ve written a whole post about the best things to do in Jaffna (which you can read here ), below are the absolute must-sees in this part of Sri Lanka: Jaffna Fort | Jaffna Fort isn’t as beautiful as its Insta-famous southern counterpart, Galle Fort . However, we did really enjoy walking its tourist-free walls and ramparts at our own pace and enjoying the great views over the moat, Jaffna Lagoon and the city. Nallur Kandiswamy | The beautiful Nallur Kandaswamy Kovil was first built as a fort in 948 when Nallur (“good city”) was an important ancient kingdom. Reconstructed twice (1450s and 1734), the towering golden-ochred temple has been calling faithful devotees to its grounds for centuries, becoming a significant landmark in Jaffna Delft Island | Delft is an outlying coral and limestone island with a long history dating from the Chola Dynasty , Portuguese, Dutch and the British Colonial Period. It's absolutely not your stereotypical postcard-worthy island, but that's all part of its charm. Read our Delft Island guide here Mangos Restaurant | Hands down the best restaurant we ate at in Jaffna! The masala dosa is incredible, and we had some of our best meals in Sri Lanka here READ | The best things to do in Jaffna - our ultimate city guide the best things to do in galle fort , sri lanka’s historic seaside fortress #6 THE BEST TIME TO VISIT JAFFNA IS FROM JANUARY TO MARCH The climate in the north of Sri Lanka is drier than the south, with average temperatures of around 28 °C We visited Jaffna in November and the weather was absolutely perfect, despite being known to be a wet month. The best time to visit, however, is anytime between January - March , when the when little rain occurs and the temperatures are manageable (learn more on our Sri Lanka travel tips post). Do avoid April if possible, when the average temperature is 34 degrees - and has travelled to Sri Lanka in this month before, we can attest that it’s also a bajillion degrees of humidity! #7 THE FOOD IN JAFFNA IS DELICIOUS The cuisine in Jaffna is very different to the southern reaches of Sri Lanka - think more South Indian in flavour, with heavier curries, biryani, dosas, and parathas. And Lassis... so many lassis! Mangos is, in our opinion, Jaffna's best (and most famous) restaurant and there the masala dosa is the best we’v ever had. We were worried that this tourist-popular spot might not live up to the hype, but we can absolutely say that we had some of our best meals in Sri Lanka here. It was so good in fact, that we went back twice! If you’re a vegetarian in Jaffna, you’re well-catered for. Sri Lanka is one of the most vegetarian and vegan-friendly countries in the whole world, thanks in large part to its predominantly Buddhist and Hindu population. While in Jaffna, we recommend trying the masala dosa, and onion bhaji, as well as any of the traditional south Indian curries, including crab curry (Mim’s fave!). plan your ultimate getaway: the best 3-week Sri Lanka itinerary #8 IT’S EASY TO GET AROUND JAFFNA One of the joys of visiting countries like Sri Lanka , India or any in Southeast Asia is that it’s super easy to get around. Simply walking out of your accommodation will be greeted with a beep and a call of “tuk tuk”. It’s bloody wonderful and Jaffna is no different. There are a plethora of tuk-tuks servicing the town, and a simple wave will grab their attention. Tuk Tuks are also quite cheap in Jaffna - we found them much cheaper than many places in the south. If you’re looking to go further, such as Delft Island or the main Jaffna tourist attractions to the north, buses, much like the south, service almost all corners of the city and surrounds. Jaffna’s main bus stand is located right in the centre of the town and is the hub for all things buses. Just be warned - like all Sri Lanka buses, they’re a little crazy. #9 IT’S SAFE IN JAFFNA, BUT BE AWARE OF YOUR SURROUNDINGS Although we can only comment on our own personal experiences, we believe Jaffna is safe for tourists. Despite having been through a tumultuous few decades during the bitter civil war that raged between the Tamils and Sinhalese, Sri Lanka, and Jaffna, felt incredibly safe. We walked around at night, jumped aboard random tuk-tuks for sunrise photo missions, strolled through the markets, caught local buses and ate in very local establishments. At NO time did we feel unsafe? There’s also a large military and police presence in the city and surrounds at all times. While this may be a little uncomfortable and makes things a little tense, the government of Sri Lanka is insistent on this presence to keep the peace (whether or not it’s needed or wanted is another story) Keep your wits about you, as you would anywhere in the world, and always travel with insurance just in case. Here are our recommendations, based on 8+ years of full-time travel: FOR TRAVELLERS | HeyMondo - COVID-19 coverage, comprehensive travel + medical insurance, an app with 24-hour medical support, and no out-of-pocket fees. * The Common Wanderer readers 5% off your policy by booking through our link here FOR DIGITAL NOMADS | SafetyWing - COVID-19 coverage, comprehensive travel & medical, and policies can be purchased while already abroad. CAR INSURANCE | Insurance4CarHire - a great annual car insurance policy #10 THE LOCAL PEOPLE ARE MORE RESERVED BUT STILL FRIENDLY The word 'friendly’ doesn’t even begin to describe how warm, genuinely kind, and generous Sri Lankan people are. And in Jaffna and the north, it's no different, despite its recent history. The one major difference we found between the people of the north and south is that they’re a little more reserved in Jaffna. We’d often find ourselves feeling a little uneasy during initial encounters, not sure if we’d done something to offend, or if we were just not welcome. We totally understand why, and it can take a little more than smiles to get beyond the tough exterior. But once rapport is built, the local people are absolutely lovely. We were freely told all the best things to see in Jaffna, including where to eat (Mangos was suggested to us by a local, and that turned out very well!). We were offered free coconuts and other fruits without any qualms, and even the tuk-tuk drivers were friendly. People seemed genuinely interested in why we were visited and offered their advice wherever possible. As tourists, you have to work a little harder for someone’s trust and respect in Jaffna, and we love that. epic adventures in sri lanka’s hills | our guide to ella, sri lanka #11 TOURISM INFRASTRUCTURE ISN’T GREAT, BUT IT’S IMPROVING Now that you know about the civil war, you can probably understand why Jaffna lacks in tourism infrastructure . That said, it is rapidly improving. During our visit to Jaffna, the signs and sounds of new construction were everywhere, including new hotels, and the renovation of a number of buildings and monuments. Many major hotel chains are now opening up, while local homes are being converted into traditional homestays (our favourite type of accommodation), which offer visitors a more authentic, local experience in the north. Many of Jaffna’s top tourist attractions have been or are being renovated, including Jaffna Fort, and many outlying temples and churches. The direct train from Colombo to Jaffna reopened in 2014 after decades closed , while buses frequent the city, connecting Jaffna to many popular southern tourist destinations (book your train to Jaffna here ). While there’s a long way to go to match the glorious restoration of Galle Fort or the rapidly expanding tourism infrastructure in Ella, Jaffna is certainly easy enough to visit and get around as a tourist. #12 ACCOMMODATION IS FAIRLY EXPENSIVE IN COMPARISON TO THE SOUTH When searching for accommodation in Jaffna, we were surprised by the prices. Even the cheapest hotels and guesthouses started at around USD $20 (LKR 3,500) per night, which is far more expensive than the prices we’d paid in the rest of Sri Lanka. The higher-end hotels, such as Jetwing Jaffna , started at around USD $60 per night. After searching high and low, we settled for a clean, comfortable hotel just outside of Jaffna town called D’Vila Garden House , which cost around USD $19 and came with breakfast. While the accommodation rates aren’t expensive when compared to the rest of the world (looking at you, Europe!), just be aware that you’ll need to pay a little more in Jaffna than you would in the south of Sri Lanka BOOK | D’Vila Garden House - comfortable, quiet, and with lovely hosts. Prices and availability here #13 HEAD OUT TO AN ISLAND FOR A TRUE CULTURAL EXPERIENCE We’re not lying when we say our trip out to the island of Delft was one of the more surreal and unique travel days we’ve ever experienced. Delft is an isolated, outlying coral and limestone island just off the coast of Jaffna with a long history dating from the ancient Chola Dynasty and Portuguese, Dutch and the British Colonial periods . Here, history tugs at your sleeve with every step you take on Delft. Amongst the swaying palms and gentle sea breeze, remnants of the island’s past are dotted throughout; quaint tiny villages, colonial ruins, winding dirt roads and coral walls hint at bygone eras and simpler times. Delft Island has not yet fully embraced modernity, or indeed tourism (or maybe it's vice versa and tourists haven't yet embraced Delft), yet there’s plenty to see and do, the locals are wonderfully friendly, and it’s entirely possible to fill a day of sightseeing without any hassles. Delft Island may not be your stereotypical postcard-worthy island, but the rustic charm of the island and the isolated nature but that's part of its charm and make it one of our favourite things to see in Jaffna .

In fact, on our first trip to Sri Lanka, we decided not to visit due to its location, far from Sri Lanka’s main attractions. But don’t let its remoteness dissuade you from visiting. From Colombo, it’s possible to take a direct train to Jaffna, which is super scenic, fairly comfortable and takes around 7-8 hours. Alternatively, you can catch a direct bus from Colombo (not recommended), or jump aboard the same bus in Kandy , or Dambulla as it makes its way north. We’ve taken both, and while we’d take the train every day of the week, the bus ride was surprisingly comfortable, and we met a lot of wonderful locals. It also gave us a chance to observe the differences as we drove north through towns and villages towards Jaffna. For more information, see below: TRAIN TO JAFFNA It might be a long, dusty journey but it’s also the most scenic. We’ve written everything you need to know about the train ride to and from Jaffna in the section below. BUS TO JAFFNA It is possible to get from Colombo to Jaffna via an overnight bus, however, we recommend breaking up the journey by stopping in Kandy or Dambulla overnight. We took a local bus from Dambulla to Jaffna which took around 7 hours, and while its an easy trip to make, be warned that the the hard wooden seats can get uncomfortable after a while! This cost us LKR 170 each.

The Colombo Fort to Jaffna train departs 5 times a day, with the earliest departure at 05:45 am and the final departure at 20:30. It takes around 7- 8 hours, and the busiest section is between Anuradhapura and Colombo (so be sure to have your seats sorted by then!). We suggest booking in advance as tickets sell out quickly - you can pre-book your tickets here . The journey also takes you past the infamous Elephant Pass , a slip of land connecting the Jaffna peninsula to the rest of Sri Lanka, which played a critical role in many battles throughou", "images": ["https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5a3bb03b4c326d76de73ddaa/3dee7601-5e54-43ae-ad0a-a28de2cea0e3/The_Common_Wanderer_-5853.jpg", "https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5a3bb03b4c326d76de73ddaa/1566404890189-30BQTTOLJX2PXPES1A8A/The_Common_Wanderer_jaffna_things_to_know-19.jpg", "https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5a3bb03b4c326d76de73ddaa/1721872423687-YZWALJ9QJ130YX5CCFS3/The_Common_Wanderer_-4628.jpg", "https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5a3bb03b4c326d76de73ddaa/1721872424021-NSQ6FTIUC0DA2QTA1S4H/The_Common_Wanderer_-4621.jpg", "https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5a3bb03b4c326d76de73ddaa/1721872480380-NB9NTKU4O6XJA6VCV5S4/The_Common_Wanderer_-4678.jpg", "https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5a3bb03b4c326d76de73ddaa/1721872482278-OL54RUKGSA0HGEVR6ZMX/The_Common_Wanderer_-4624.jpg", "https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5a3bb03b4c326d76de73ddaa/1721872483070-3AHKXWRKL3RHV7OC4AF2/The_Common_Wanderer_-4532.jpg", "https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5a3bb03b4c326d76de73ddaa/1721872635063-T7GZDR7YUEJ1CHCLHYNJ/The_Common_Wanderer_-5757.jpg", "https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5a3bb03b4c326d76de73ddaa/1721872740328-NIQPGYMWXWAP5FW00ZPA/The_Common_Wanderer_-.jpg", "https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5a3bb03b4c326d76de73ddaa/1721872740535-T9N0U5XT9AKKZM64DU0T/The_Common_Wanderer_-0627.jpg", "https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5a3bb03b4c326d76de73ddaa/1721872802032-B1LG4L4AJR95OUQRD41I/The_Common_Wanderer_-4488.jpg", "https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5a3bb03b4c326d76de73ddaa/1721872803522-X52EIUCBF2W9MOBFX66Y/The_Common_Wanderer_-5595.jpg", "https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5a3bb03b4c326d76de73ddaa/25ab13de-a9ee-454c-bd81-d16015eca883/The_Common_Wanderer_-4777.jpg", "https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5a3bb03b4c326d76de73ddaa/1566406077188-6HZLRW5F5SJ5MJR2MEB5/The_Common_Wanderer_jaffna_things_to_know-23.jpg", "https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5a3bb03b4c326d76de73ddaa/c50d7994-f913-453e-b9d1-8c6551375ddc/The_Common_Wanderer_-4508.jpg", "https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5a3bb03b4c326d76de73ddaa/1754377570264-LFZYWYUHWS2C8LHBO77I/The_Common_Wanderer_-2.jpg", "https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5a3bb03b4c326d76de73ddaa/1734411155344-PZ7AF1XZ7U4B9CGNI0FQ/The_Common_Wanderer_-498+%281%29.jpg", "https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5a3bb03b4c326d76de73ddaa/1731649288111-MDL4G4863I6IW1T7EUEJ/The_Common_Wanderer_-502+%281%29.jpg", "https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5a3bb03b4c326d76de73ddaa/1721277162374-NZH5HA2ZCKXVMIQN8ZRU/The_Common_Wanderer_-33-2.jpg", "https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5a3bb03b4c326d76de73ddaa/1675246805540-7WNC2K7WA0RLYFQQWS4R/The_Common_Wanderer_-9166-2.jpg", "https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5a3bb03b4c326d76de73ddaa/1670900362617-F50ZROC1WJIOXUMFKGYX/The+Common+Wanderer-6499+%283%29.jpg", "https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5a3bb03b4c326d76de73ddaa/1721969731038-N6MQYB7AIDI6QSOPX4L6/The_Common_Wanderer_-230-2+%282%29.jpg", "https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5a3bb03b4c326d76de73ddaa/1675503351527-YC18BYNS8NWMJVW71GTD/The+Common+Wanderer-9897-4+%281%29.jpg", "https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5a3bb03b4c326d76de73ddaa/1712815660165-AP22GVVWJFN9DAGAA76S/The_Common_Wanderer_-119+%281%29.jpg", "https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5a3bb03b4c326d76de73ddaa/1721870846834-RW5VDH1VDJ2GCQGZNP5W/The_Common_Wanderer_-4528.jpg", "https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5a3bb03b4c326d76de73ddaa/1704417357111-61RPMBIZZKETYS3DG25M/The+Common+Wanderer-133-2.jpg", "https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5a3bb03b4c326d76de73ddaa/1721283300176-WNANJDX78R3AUNQ6RTLQ/The_Common_Wanderer_-146.jpg", "https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v2/namespaces/memberAccountAvatars/libraries/59b1acb3f5e231475663379e/c7ace3d6aaf04874890a308cf8605f3b/c7ace3d6aaf04874890a308cf8605f3b.jpeg?format=300w"]}

So, what are you waiting for? Book that ticket and enjoy this little island paradise as much as we did. SRI LANKA TRAVEL GUIDE | WHAT TO SEE, KNOW, AND DO IN SRI LANKA THINGS TO KNOW BEFORE YOU VISIT SRI LANKA WHERE IS SRI LANKA? Sri Lanka is an island country located in the Indian Ocean, south of India and the Bay of Bengal, east of Africa and the Middle East, and west of Indonesia and southeast Asia. Sri Lanka’s largest city, and capital, Colombo , is located in the southwest of the country and is home to the majority of Sri Lanka’s 21 million people. Sri Lanka’s history dates back over 125,000 years, and its documented history is 3,000, making it rich with cultural heritage. THE BEST TIME TO VISIT SRI LANKA | SRI LANKA WEATHER Sri Lanka’s weather is punctuated by two separate monsoons affecting different parts of the island at different times of year, your trip will require a little pre-research to know what’s ‘in season’. The main monsoon, \"Yala”, occurs from April/May to September on the west and southwest coasts (including main tourism sites such as Galle , Unawatuna , and the southern coast), with the wettest months from April - June. The less severe “Maha” monsoon usually hits the east coast from November to March (including Arugam Bay and Trincomalee). December to March is the best time to visit Sri Lanka if you want to visit the incredible sights of the south and central areas. Alternatively, April/May to September is the best time to visit Sri Lanka if you’re keen to hit the surf breaks of Arugam Bay and Trincomalee, READ | Our top Sri Lanka travel tips SRI LANKA TOURIST VISA INFORMATION Tourist visas are generally issued for a 30-day period, and it’s best to organise it via ETA (Electronic Travel Authority) before you arrive in the country. To organise your visa, head to the ETA website about a week before your arrival, pay the fee via credit card, and then you should receive the visa confirmation within a couple of days. On our most recent trip to Sri Lanka (2024), we applied for and received our visa within three working days. However, we suggest applying at least a week in advance, preferably two weeks to be safe, as you must have a valid visa to board your inbound flight. Prices for the ETA Visa are (as of 2024): SAARC countries | USD $35 for 30 days with double entry Non-SAARC | USD $75 for 30 days with double entry According to the Department of Immigration, all Tourist or Business travellers to Sri Lanka must have e-Visa to enter Sri Lanka (as of 17th April 2024). If you decide you love Sri Lanka too much to leave just yet (we don’t blame you!), you can renew your 30-day visa twice, and for 30 days each time. To extend your visa, download the relevant form here , fill it in, and take it to the Department of Immigration & Emigration, Colombo . Get there as early as possible, and prepare to spend a few hours navigating the Sri Lankan bureaucratic system! INTERNET, WIFI AND DATA IN SRI LANKA On our most recent trip to Sri Lanka , we purchased local SIM cards at the airport and topped up with data as we needed, and we feel like this is the best option for any travel to Sri Lanka. Across the country, 4G is readily available, and seems to enjoy a better signal than we used to get living in Australia! Better yet, buying pay-as-you-go credit is affordable. On previous visits to Sri Lanka, we’ve used the Dialog network, who have free sim cards available to travellers at the airport, and LKR 1300 (USD $9) will get you 9GB of data and LKR 350 of local calls. To top up, simply head to any little convenience shop. Alternatively, if may be worth investing in an international e-SIM, or using any travel plans with your home telecom provider. Wifi is available in almost all main restaurants, cafes and hotels, and is fairly quick in major cities. DRINKING WATER IN SRI LANKA | CAN I DRINK TAP WATER IN SRI LANKA? Tap water in Sri Lanka generally isn’t safe for drinking, but that absolutely doesn’t mean that you need to go buy plastic bottled water just to stay hydrated. Travel with a water purification system (we recommend The Grayl ), and you can fill up directly from the tap, purify your water to filter out any nasties, and drink with confidence. We haven’t bought bottled water in over 18 months, and despite travelling through some places with very questionable water (Sri Lanka included), we’re yet to encounter a single tummy bug. Not a single one! BUY | The Grayl water purification bottle related | our top sri lanka travel tips MONEY MATTERS WHAT’S SRI LANKA’S CURRENCY? Sri Lanka’s currency is the Sri Lankan Rupee. The currency code is LKR. Denominations include ₨10, ₨20, ₨50, ₨100, ₨500, ₨1000, ₨2000, ₨5000. The exchange rate currently is 1 USD = 177 LKR & 1 GBP = 216 LKR From tuk-tuk drivers to restaurants, and grocery stores to tour operators, this is a country that runs on cash. However, on our most recent visit in 2024, there was a shift to cash-free in major tourist destinations, such as Colombo, Galle, Ahangama and Hiriketiya. CASH OR CARD IN SRI LANKA? While ATM and card facilities are pretty widely accessible in the main tourist areas, they can’t always be relied upon. We’d recommend withdrawing as many Sri Lankan rupees (we’d withdraw upwards of LKR 40,000) as you need in batches (from the ATM rather than a currency exchange so you don’t get ripped off), and using that to pay your way instead. WHAT DOES IT COST TO TRAVEL IN SRI LANKA? In our experience, the cost of travel in Sri Lanka is affordable, but it’s definitely pricier when you compare it with many of its Asian neighbours. However, as of 2024, the recent economic issues have caused rampant inflation, which has seen the cost of goods and services increase across the country. This has trickled down to most tourism offerings, with some restaurants, bars and hotels in major hotspots as expensive as those in Europe. Overall, we’d suggest budgeting for around USD $50 - $200 per day including accommodation, food and transport, depending on your budget. It’s worth noting that local food and public transport in Sri Lanka are particularly cheap, with our longest train ride ( Jaffna to Colombo) only setting us back $2 each, and most local meals coming in between $2 - $6 per person, so for those on a backpackers budget, we suggest hyper local travel. COST OF FOOD + DRINK IN SRI LANKA Sri Lankan food is absolutely delicious, and the local and street food is extremely affordable. Street food | USD 50c - $3 Rice and Curry | USD $1-3 Main local meals | USD $1-5 Expensive Western meals | USD $10 - $30 Beer | USD $2-5 (alcohol is very expensive in Sri Lanka) Bottled Water | Buy a Grayl bottle and never worry about bottled water again… COST OF ACCOMMODATION IN SRI LANKA The real budget breaker in Sri Lanka is accommodation, which we found to be pretty pricey on our four trips to the Island. Cheap hotels, hostels and private rooms in guesthouses are priced at about USD $15-25 per night, while for those looking to experience the best of Sri Lanka, including 4* + accommodation, expect to pay a little more, upwards of USD $200 per night. When compared to western pricing it’s still very much a budget destination, but for those travelling on a backpacker budget, it’s something to be aware of. Below is a breakdown of accommodation pricing (as of 2024): Guesthouse | USD $10-20 per night, depending on location/season Airbnb | USD $15 per night 3* Hotel | USD $30 - $100 per night 5* Hotel | USD $200+ per night COST OF TRANSPORT IN SRI LANKA One of the most affordable aspects of Sri Lanka is its transport. Public transport (trains & intercity buses) are subsidised by the Government, so are extremely affordable for the most thrifty traveller. In addition, despite record high fuel prices, private transfers between destinations are still quite affordable - for instance, a private car from Hiriketiya to Negombo Airport will set you back around USD $60 - $100, which we feel is very reasonable. Depending on your budget, we suggest using a mix of both private and public transport in Sri Lanka. Below is a breakdown of transport pricing (as of 2024): Local Bus | USD $2 Express bus | USD $3-5 depending on distances Trains | USD $3-10 depending on distances and classes Tuk tuks | 50c per kilometre, however, longer distances can be negotiated. Expensive in cities, so always negotiate Private cars | USD $10 - 100, depending on distances HOW TO GET TO AND FROM SRI LANKA Being an island in the middle of the Indian Ocean, pretty much the only way to get to Sri Lanka is by plane. Right now, the main gateway to the country is Bandaranaike International Airport , at Katunayake, 30km north of the capital Colombo . The main frustration with the airport is the distance to Colombo - in traffic, it can take over an hour to arrive at Colombo Fort. BOOK | Use Skyscanner to find the best price We’d suggest booking a taxi to Colombo (around LKR 2,500). Taxis are regulated from the airport and prices are almost always fixed, so you can be comfortable knowing you’re not being ripped off. Alternatively, you can walk outside the airport grounds to hire a tuk-tuk, which should cost marginally less (but is far less comfortable). In general, airfares to Sri Lanka remain consistent, however, it pays to book well in advance to secure the cheapest deal. FROM EUROPE Sri Lankan Airlines operates direct flights from London. For those flying from other parts of Europe, expect to stop in either the Middle East or Southeast Asia for your connecting flights. FROM NORTH AMERICA Flying from North America to Sri Lanka is like Australians flying to Europe - it’s a loooong way! Flights from the West Coast often connect through Asia, while flights from the East Coast connect through the Middle East or Asia. Either way, expect a 20+ hour flight time. FROM ASIA Just a hop, skip and a jump from Asia, Sri Lanka is obviously well-serviced by major Asian airlines, including budget airlines such as Air Asia. Prices can be competitive, so it’s worth using Skyscanner to find the best price. FROM AUSTRALIA Sri Lankan Airlines operates direct flights from Melbourne to Colombo daily, however, if you’re leaving from any other capital city in Australia, you’ll need to stop-over in southeast Asia. For cheaper fares, budget airlines such as Air Asia operate the route through Kuala Lumpur. TRANSPORT IN SRI LANKA | HOW TO GET AROUND SRI LANKA Due to Sri Lanka’s small size and abundance of transport options, getting around the island is easy, if not a little time consuming and uncomfortable. Buses and tuk tuks are the most common form of transport on the island, and service even the most remote corners. Buses, however, are a fraction of the cost of tuk tuks and oftentimes make for a much faster journey from A to B. The most picturesque form of transport, however, is Sri Lanka’s train network. The network may be slow, cumbersome, and somewhat unreliable, but it services all the main areas of the island and provides travellers with rich cultural experiences that just aren’t as common in western countries. If public transport isn’t your thing or time is of the essence, it is possible to arrange a private transfer, however the cost is often prohibitive for a backpacker budget. HOW TO GET AROUND SRI LANKA BY TRAIN This is the method of transport that basically put Sri Lanka on the map; the iconic images of the blue train weaving through the thick jungle of Ella and Horton Plains is almost everywhere you look online now! But, as with most tourist hotspots, there’s a reason for its popularity. This is the cheap, slow, and scenic way of getting around the country, and honestly, some of the world’s greatest train journeys happen right here in Sri Lanka, including Colombo to Kandy , Kandy to Ella , Colombo to Galle . There are three ticket classes with reserved and unreserved seating classifications in each. Our personal favourite is third class (generally reserved), where we could have some awesome local interactions, see some amazing sights with a little less cramping, and of course, get some epic shots out the train window/door. Second class is less busy and slightly more comfortable, but you’re a little more removed from the action, as we found that many of the doors are locked (no hanging out the doorways here!). We absolutely love the train experience in Sri Lanka; from the colour and chaos of it all, to the clacking noise of the trains and the constant energy of chai sellers, local touts hawking their wares, kids singing, families excitedly watching for the next best view, and plenty of people to chat and make new friends with. For timetables, we recommend checking at the station in each destination, but to give you an idea head to the Sri Lankan Railways site here . READ | Our guide to the Kandy to Ella train ride , Colombo to Kandy , Colombo to Galle BOOK | Book your Sri Lankan train tickets here HOW TO GET AROUND SRI LANKA BY BUS Bus routes cover about 80% of the nation’s 90,000km of roads. Loud, sweaty, chaotic, slow, bumpy, busy… bus rides in Sri Lanka are a real experience. These ever-present metal beasts screech around every corner of the island at what seems like minute intervals throughout the day, meaning locals and tourists alike can get just about anywhere at anytime. On top of that, they’re by far the cheapest mode of transport on the Island, with trips setting you back between LKR 30 - 400 depending on trip length (for example, our seven-hour bus ride from Dambulla to Jaffna cost just LKR 350). For those on a budget or looking for some authentic Sri Lankan experiences, this is your best bet. A few tips for bus travel in Sri Lanka: Prices are fixed You’ll need small change to pay your fare If you’re backpacking, backpacks can go on the front engine hub next to driver or in the rear luggage compartment... ask the attendant where to put it HOW TO GET AROUND SRI LANKA BY EXPRESS BUS There are times when jumping on the local bus is the cheap and fun way to travel about; then there are other times when you just want to sit in a little bit of comfort and get to your destination as quickly as possible. The express bus system that runs in the south is the perfect answer to this; small, air-conditioned mini buses that run regular routes between places like Galle and Colombo (LKR 450) or Kandy to Dambulla (LKR 410). They’re quick, efficient, and comfortable if not a little splurge compared to other modes of transport. BOOK | Book your Sri Lankan bus tickets here HOW TO GET AROUND SRI LANKA BY TUK TUK If there’s one mode of transport that always signals adventure in this part of the world, the zippy little tuk-tuk is definitely it. These colourful three-wheeled auto-rickshaws weave in and around the traffic and are omnipresent around the island, so you can be sure that you jump in one pretty much anywhere you go. The tuk-tuk is a great way to get around cities quickly and efficiently, and they’re generally happy to take you just about anywhere. Just be sure that you either negotiate the fare before you jump in - or, if available, ask them to turn on the meter. We actually refused to use any Tuk tuks in Colombo that weren’t running on metered fares thanks to a few ‘tuk tuk mafia’ idiots ruining it for everyone else. It is also possible to take a tuk-tuk between cities/destinations, and while it’s not a huge expense, it will obviously cost you more than the local bus would. To give you an idea, we once caught a Tuk tuk from Udawalawe National Park to Mirissa (a 3-hour journey) for USD $30. The tuk tuk is also an awesome way to see the local countryside, with the opportunity to stop at various spots along the way. A few tips for using tuk-tuks in Sri Lanka: Always negotiate, unless you’re happy with the fee Use the PICKME app in Colombo or Kandy (essentially Uber for tuk tuks) Always get to know your driver - they’re always wonderfully friendly and happy to provide local recommendations for food etc. Tipping isn’t necessary unless the service was great or you thought they were awesome people.

Read the guide here Do note that despite having been through a tumultuous few decades during the bitter civil war that raged between the Tamils and Sinhalese, Sri Lanka has always felt like an incredibly safe destination to travel to for us. That being said, the recent terrorist bombings in April 2019 left the world in shock and the country reeling. The attacks by local extremists, which killed over 250 people, including tourists, targeted popular tourist hotels around Colombo, as well as throughout around the country. The targets were clear, and the outcome was horrific. Then, in 2022, there were widespread protests as a result of the Government mismanaging the economy (among other things), which sent the country into a severe economic crisis. This set the country back yet again, however, it had a limited effect on tourist infra", "images":

This guide includes things to do, essential travel information and travel tips. Our day trip to Delft Island ( Neduntheevu in Tamil, or Neduntivu in Sinhala), 30kms off the Jaffna coast in Northern Sri Lanka , was long, arduous, yet the most unique on our trip to Sri Lanka. The journey to Delft begins at Kurikadduwan harbour, about an hour south-west of Jaffna. After a bumpy, enclosed, hour-long ferry ride, you arrive onto the mysterious, isolated, outlying coral and limestone island. With a long history dating right from the ancient Chola Dynasty through Portuguese, Dutch and the British Colonial periods , history tugs at your sleeve with every step you take on Delft. Amongst the swaying palms and gentle sea breeze, remnants of the island’s past are dotted throughout; quaint tiny villages, colonial ruins, winding dirt roads and coral walls hint at bygone eras and simpler times. Although Delft has not yet fully embraced modernity, or indeed tourism (or maybe it's vice versa and tourists haven't yet embraced Delft), we feel it only adds to the rustic charm of the island. There’s plenty to see and do, the locals are wonderfully friendly, and it’s entirely possible to fill a day of sightseeing without any hassles. Just don’t arrive expecting to find food - despite the island’s 6,000 full-time inhabitants, the island is devoid of any restaurants! Delft Island may not be your stereotypical postcard-worthy island, but that's part of its charm and makes it one of our favourite things to see in Jaffna . From how to get there, what to see, and what to know before you visit, this is our guide to Delft Island! A VISIT TO THE UNIQUE & MYSTERIOUS DELFT ISLAND DELFT ISLANDS DAY TRIP PLANNING ESSENTIALS Before we delve into our intriguing day tour of Delft Islands, below are a few trip-planning essentials to make life easier for you. Before heading to Delft Island, we found it very hard to find correct information - what was online different from our Lonely Planet Guide, which was different from our homestay host. After an eventful, yet fun trip, below is all the information you could need to make your own way to the Island, including how to get there, how to get around, and if food is even available on the island! WHERE IS DELFT ISLAND? Delft island is smack bang in the middle of the Palk Strait, separating northern Sri Lanka from southern India. The island’s about 30km west of Jaffna city, and is just 8km in length and 6km at its widest. HOW TO GET TO DELFT ISLAND FROM JAFFNA From Jaffna, you need to get to Kurikadduwan Harbour ( map ), about an hour away. Take the 776 from Jaffna bus station (LKR 90 per person), departing at 6:30, or a tuk-tuk (LKR 2000). The ferry for Delft leaves Kurikadduwan harbour at 8 am or 9 am (LKR 100 per person), with a maximum number of 100 passengers, so it's important to get there 30 minutes before departure. Be warned though, this ferry ride is not for the faint-hearted. It's on a rusty old ferry which looks like it could sink at any moment. Thankfully, it actually functions pretty well. Returning home, we recommend catching the 14:30 ferry back to Kurikadduwan harbour. We've read that some people have arrived at 13:30 only to be rushed onto a boat, so check with your tuk-tuk driver as to when you need to be back at the jetty for the return ride home. Once back at Kurikadduwan Jetty, there will be a bus waiting to take you back to Jaffna. The bus will be full, so try and run to get a seat as the return ride home is extremely bumpy. HOW TO GET FROM JAFFNA TO DELFT ISLAND MAP HOW TO GET AROUND DELFT ISLAND, JAFFNA Upon arrival at the Delft Island harbour, you can organise a tuk-tuk to take you to all the major sights on the Island. There are a number of tuk-tuk drivers waiting for tourist arrivals, so you shouldn’t have any issues organising a tour. Expect to pay between LKR 1500 - 2500 for the four-five hour tour. WHY YOU SHOULD VISIT DELFT ISLAND Sri Lanka is currently experiencing a tourism boom, thanks in part to Lonely Planet who named it the number 1 destination to visit in 2019 . With everyone from backpackers to luxury travellers flocking to this island paradise, the main attractions can sometimes feel a little busy and overrun in the southern and central reaches of the island. But this isn’t so in the north, where the region is finally rebuilding after a bloody 26 year civil war, which only ended in 2009 . The north of Sri Lanka is seriously raw, and Delft Island takes authenticity to a whole new level. It's so remote and off the beaten track that at times you feel like you're on another planet. It's somewhere where modern life doesn't exist beyond a few random power lines and the faint 3G signal from the mainland. Delft Island is also the first place we've witnessed the perils of climate change first-hand. Rising sea levels have led to an increased water level over the whole island, affecting crops, homes and ancient sites. It was seriously confronting for us both to be walking through fields in ankle-deep water, and an experience that has driven us to become even more environmentally conscious since. Life on the island is simple yet intriguing, so if you're a fan of authentic, off-the-beaten-track travel experiences, Delft Island is definitely worth your while. 31 incredible things to do in sri lanka | the ultimate bucket list WHAT TO SEE AND DO ON DELFT ISLAND, JAFFNA Surprisingly for a near-deserted limestone/coral island in the middle of the straits between Sri Lanka and India, Delft Island is full of historical sites to see and things to do. Local tuk-tuk drivers will greet you at Delft Harbour and offer to take you on a tour of the island, which takes around four hours and visit all the main sites and attractions. We recommend taking them up on this as the island is hard to navigate, and the major sites are dotted randomly throughout the island. It also allows you to witness the island’s unique landscapes, while getting a local’s insight to life here. Of the 10 or so main attractions on the island, we recommend visiting the following: THE PORTUGUESE & DUTCH FORT Situated under tall Palmyra palms, this ruined ancient Fort (originally built by the Portuguese) constructed out of limestone and coral, was eventually turned into a Fort by the Dutch. It's free to explore to your heart’s content. THE DELFT ISLAND BAOBAB TREE A huge baobab native to tropical Africa was planted on Delft in the 16th century by Arab merchants. After spending so much time in Africa, it was pretty flipping weird to see baobab trees here in Sri Lanka. THE OLD DUTCH HOSPITAL This old hospital was built by the Dutch and converted into an administrative centre in the early 1900s. In 'The Courts', there's a British Emblem inscribed on the wall, which gives you an insight into the reach of the British Empire. PIGEON NEST Set in the gardens of the Old Dutch Hospital is a unique structure used to house messenger pigeons during the Dutch reign. The pigeons used to carry messages between Delft Island and Jaffna. DUTCH HORSE STABLES The island of Delft was used as a breeding ground for Dutch horses, so there are several ancient stables on the island. The stables are now crumbling, with 64 pillars visible where horses were formerly tied up. When we visited, the area was underwater, which made for a unique experience HANUMAN’S FOOTPRINT The giant human-like footprint embedded in the rock is somewhat of a myth, but the local inhabitants believe it was left by Hanuman, the king of monkeys and the devoted servant of Rama.

To view on the road, open Google Maps, click the menu button, go to “Your Places,” click Maps, and you will see this exact map on your list. Everything you need to know before visiting Sri Lanka WHERE TO EAT AND DRINK ON DELFT ISLAND Food can be hard to come by on the Island; there's one restaurant called Delft Hotel located just off the Jetty which serves vegetable roti and wade, otherwise a few small market stores sell snacks. There's another 'hotel' close to the jetty called ‘ Island Hut ’ which serves curries and fresh seafood. We definitely recommend you bring at least 2L of water (in a reusable bottle of course - buy here), and food for the day, including snacks.

Includes detailed instructions on how to get there, what to do, and what to be careful of! UPDATED - July 2024 GO. CHASE. DIYALUMA. WATERFALL. That’s our advice after visiting Sri Lanka 's second tallest and most impressive waterfall, Diyaluma. Located a little off the beaten track in the Sri Lankan highlands (about an hour from Ella), Diyaluma Falls is home to epic views and some of the best natural infinity pools in the world. After a two-hour tuk-tuk ride from Ella to Poonagala through quintessentially lush Sri Lankan tea plantations, it’s a 30-minute tramp downhill between long, dry grasses before the first glimpse of the upper falls comes into view. A short hike further and you’re standing on what seems like the edge of the world, watching the cascading water drop 220m to the valley below. Unfortunately for us, we visited during the wet season, so were unable to swim in the lower Diyaluma Falls pools (we value our life a little too much). We watched the sunset over the valley below from the top of the falls, joined by a group of young local guys keen to chat about our travels (and cricket, of course!). We flew our drone, snapped a few shots, and relaxed before reluctantly commencing our journey back to Ella. It was the perfect afternoon trip from Ella and one of our favourite things to do in Sri Lanka . To help you make the most of your visit here, we’ve put together this guide to Diyaluma with everything you need to know. LOVE OUR PHOTOS? Edit like us with our Tropical Dreams Preset Packs , and Tropical Bliss mobile video filters, inspired by the tropical beauty and colour of this beautiful country A GUIDE TO DIYALUMA FALLS, SRI LANKA’S SECOND-TALLEST WATERFALL WHERE IS DIYALUMA WATERFALL? Diyaluma Falls are located in Sri Lanka's Badulla district on the Colombo - Badulla highway, about 6km east of the regional town of Koslanda, and around 30km south of Ella. Diyaluma Falls was originally formed by Kirindi Oya, a river that starts near Bandarawela and flows through central Sri Lanka. Where to stay in Ella : Options for all budgets HOW TO GET TO DIYALUMA FALLS, SRI LANKA Getting to Diyaluma Falls isn't an overly easy feat. That said, due to its growing popularity many of the local tuk-tuk drivers know exactly where to go. For that reason, we’d recommend making the trip with a tuk-tuk driver instead of taking it on yourself. There are two ways to get to the top of Diyaluma Falls: 1) from Poonagala village at the top, which is far shorter and easier, or 2) hiking from the bottom near the village of Koslanda, which is rather strenuous and hard to follow. Below are details of the hike from Poonagala village, which we did personally: DIYALUMA FALLS FROM POONAGALA After our two-hour tuk-tuk ride from Ella , we arrived in the local tea village of Poonagala and the starting point of our hike to Diyaluma Falls. From the village, walk south until you find the footpath right by the Makaldeniya bend, and the pathway emerging from the grassland. Follow this pathway downhill as this will lead you to Upper Diyaluma Falls. The tuk-tuk from Ella town to Poonagala should cost around LKR 3,500 - 5,000 in return. Remember to tell your tuk-tuk driver you wish to go to the upper Diyaluma Falls and hike from there. sri lanka’s mountain paradise | our complete guide to ella THE HIKE TO DIYALUMA FALLS POONGALA - DIYALUMA FALLS We hiked from Poongala, and the trailhead for the Diyaluma Falls hike can be found here (we suggest saving it to an offline map as there is limited service in the area). You may be asked if you want a guide - this is completely up to you, however, our tuk-tuk driver accompanied us on the hike, so we said no. The first part of the hike is downhill through long, dry grass. Follow the path for around 30 minutes stopping only to admire the surrounding views and for a sip of water, which you’ll need in the oppressive, humid heat. Make sure you wear shoes - the path is uneven, and parts are overgrown, which resulted in a few cuts on our legs. You’ll soon begin to hear the sound of water rushing long before the stunning upper Diyaluma Falls become clear. It’s not long before the viewpoint of the upper falls appears, at which point the pathway starts to descend sharply to the lower falls below. If you have time, you can take the path right and head up to the top of Diyaluma Falls, where more manageable natural swimming pools exist, and then follow the pathway to the lower part of the falls. While the path isn't signposted, it's super easy to follow and seems to be pretty well maintained. From here, it's a short walk down to the lower section of Sri Lanka's 2nd tallest waterfall, Diyaluma and the incredible 220m drop to the valley floor below. KOSLANDA - DIYALUMA FALLS The hike can also be completed from below the falls near the town of Koslanda. The trailhead starts here . The lower falls hike is a little more strenuous, with about 20-30 mins of some fairly tough uphill trekking, however, you’ll be able to witness the falls from below at Diyaluma Falls Bridge, which makes it an appealing alternative to hiking from Poongala village. Additionally, there are a number of small stalls where you can buy snacks or coconuts, which are much needed after hiking in the heat. Which trailhead you commence from is most likely going to be up to your tuk-tuk driver and where they drop you off - however, both are similar in terms of time and intensity. the best of ella | a guide to ella’s famous nine arch bridge WHAT TO DO AT DIYALUMA FALLS SWIM IN NATURAL INFINITY POOLS During the summer months when the water levels have dropped, you can enjoy a refreshing swim at the various natural pools, including right on the edge of the main waterfall. It's the best infinity pool in the world, and definitely worth a chilly dip. Alternatively, there are several larger, safer pools at the upper Diyaluma Falls, but again, take precautions before diving in. CHILL ON THE SURROUNDING ROCKS Where else in the world can you sit on the edge of a cliff next to a gushing 220m tall waterfall and just relax? After a tough journey and hike to get to Diyaluma Falls, we recommend sitting down on the rocky ledge, having some lunch and admiring the view for an hour or so. Remember to bring a towel or something to sit on. CHAT WITH LOCALS When we visited Diyaluma Falls, there were a large group of locals who wanted to learn all about us. \"Where are you from\" was the most common question, followed by question after question about cricket! On the flip side, we asked everything we could about the country, the somewhat volatile political situation at the time, and of course where to find the best rice and curry! It's important to embrace these travel moments, and chatting with locals is a great way to learn more about the local culture. our essential traveller’s guide to kandy, sri lanka SAFETY AT DIYALUMA FALLS At this point, we should warn you that safety barriers do not exist at Diyaluma Falls, so if you're an adrenaline junkie (like Mark), and like to stand on the edge of just about anything, please be careful. During the summer months, it's possible to swim in the falls. You should always take precautions, including checking the forecast or speaking with locals about the weather situation in the area, and not diving in head first. Please, don’t attempt to swim in the falls during the monsoonal periods, as the water level is far higher and the currents much more powerful. During the rainy season (Sept - early Dec), the heavy water flow makes it impossible to swim at the lower falls. The upper falls are a little safer, though please check with locals on the day you arrive.

UPDATED - JULY 2024 Unawatuna, one of Sri Lanka's most popular beach towns, is a place you either love or hate. For us, it’s a mix of both. It’s the natural entry point to the stunning southern coast, a beachside extension to the heavenly streets of Galle Fort , and an easy, affordable place to drop and flop. But in recent years, the appeal of Unawatuna has shifted. In 2019, we enjoyed that there was a little bit more life than other Sri Lankan beach towns, with a vibe similar to that of backpacker haunts in Thailand or Cambodia . We found hipster cafes which lured us in with their delicious menus, and the nightlife the most happening in all of Sri Lanka. During the day we lazed by the surrounding beaches and spent time shopping (or at least looking) in the many of the boutique and market stalls. But in 2024, the proxy war in Eastern Europe has led to a large influx of visitors who have shifted the appeal of this town. No longer hip or bohemian, it’s now a little more brash, where you’re more likely to sip vodka or devour shakshuka than you are to enjoy affordable rice & curry on the streets, and a boogie on the beach. Additionally, the ramshackle and destructive nature of development has deprived Unawatuna of its former glory, leaving us feeling a little unsatisfied. Family homes now sit alongside large-scale hotels, and what used to be a paradise now resembles a concrete jungle, aimed solely at Eastern European tourists. Having visited twice now, we’re convinced that there are many other, better beachside hamlets on the south coast such as nearby Ahangama, Weligama and Hiriketiya. That being said, Unawatuna still has its appeal for any first-time visitor to Sri Lanka. There are some excellent, hipster restaurants and cafes, golden sands, and a relaxed vibe (it is Sri Lanka, after all). Its proximity to Galle Fort makes it a great destination to enjoy culture alongside a lazy beach holiday. This Unawatuna guide is designed to help you navigate the town, and enjoy the best parts of the town while avoiding the undesirable corners. It features the best places to stay, eat and play, and how to get the best out of your stay. LOVE OUR PHOTOS?

The rope swing at Dalawella beach, just south of Unawatuna, went viral on Instagram and before long every single visitor to the country wanted 'that shot'. In all honesty, we thought about giving this a miss - it just felt a little gimmicky for our travel tastes. But we’re also suckers when it comes to FOMO, and eventually decided to give it a go. The verdict? It’s definitely worth it. Yes, our photos turned out well, but more importantly, it really is a heap of fun and definitely one of the best things to do in Unawatuna! The best time to visit is during the early-mid morning when the sun is still rising yet not too harsh, or during golden hour as the sunsets. It costs LKR 500 for 5 or so swings, depending on how busy it is. There's also a beach swing just a short walk away at Mihiripenna beach which swings over the natural lagoon. This swing is slightly cheaper, at LKR 300 and is best visited for sunrise.

As it turns out, Skinny Tom’s has a bit of a cult following on the southern coast, and after two weeks of rice and curry at every meal, we were ready for a Melbourne-style brunch and coffee. Skinny Tom’s was a lifesaver! We had a Sri Lankan/Western infusion brunch of poached egg hoppers and shakshuka hoppers respectively, both of which were delicious. The coffee was also great. There’s also a traditional brunch on offer, as well as cakes and other sweets. We’ve also heard that their coconut crushed ice drinks are insanely good, and everyone around us seemed to be enjoying one… The pull of a freshly roasted coffee was too strong for Mim though!

To be honest, after the hustle and bustle of Colombo, the heat of Galle, and the crazy busy surf at some of the other beaches, it was perfect. Unawatuna main beach is one of the most famous beaches in the country and is popular with both tourists and locals alike. The best place to swim is in the middle or to the south of the beach, where there are less people and less boats. Alternatively, you can rent a sunbed and relax, order cocktails and curries from the beachside bars, or take an afternoon stroll up to the pagoda north of the beach and watch the sunset. The only thing to watch out for is the numerous sellers plying their wares on the beach, who are pretty persistent and can get quite annoying after a while. THE DETAILS Where | Unawatuna main beach stay safe and love lanka | our top travel tips for sri lanka #4 COFFEE AND BOOKS AT WILD & THE SAGE A quaint cafe-cum-bookstore housed in a renewed Art Deco home alongside the bustling southern highway, Wild & the Sage is, without question, Unawatuna’s best cafe. The interior is filled with floor-to-ceiling bookshelves, sofas and cosy nooks, while the garden is leafy and relaxed - it all makes for the most wonderful little environment in which to spend a few hours reading, enjoying a coffee and decompressing. Alongside coffee, the café serves a range of sweet treats, including vegan options, while running regular events such as book clubs, workshops and kids entertainment (see event schedule here ). #5 RELAX AT JUNGLE BEACH Jungle Beach was suggested to us by many of the locals as one of the best things to do in Unawatuna, so we decided to spend a morning hiking there to see what all the fuss was about. After a 30-minute walk through the jungle, we landed on the beach situated in the bay of Galle and overlooking Galle Fort . The first beach, which was packed full of locals enjoying their Sunday swim, was a little polluted for our liking, with plastic just about everywhere. However, the second beach, just a short walk away was much nicer and far less busy. That said, as we were leaving it seemed to be the place for locals to come and spend the afternoon drinking and pumping music (and, a few told us later, occasionally get into fights) - which isn’t our scene for a beach day. While it's not the best beach in Sri Lanka, it's far quieter than Unawatuna main beach and definitely worth half a day's visit. If you're hungry or thirsty, there's a little beach hut selling fresh seafood and refreshments on the beach. THE DETAILS Where | Jungle beach, Unawatuna How to get to Jungle Beach | From Unawatuna main beach, follow Yaddihemulla Rd, until the junction, then turn right onto Jungle Beach road and follow the signs all the way to the beach. The walk should take 20 minutes. Alternatively, catch a tuk-tuk to Jungle Beach, which should cost no more than 200r sri lanka’s culture capital | the best things to do in kandy #6 ENJOY THE VIEWS FROM THE JAPANESE PEACE PAGODA Located in the forest on the hillside north of Unawatuna beach is the impressive Japanese Peace Pagoda. Constructed in 2005 by Japanese monks as part of a scheme to build peace temples in conflict zones, the monument serves as a beacon of hope for people all over the world. It's now become a popular tourist attraction and on, with incredible views over the bay of Galle towards Galle Fort and the perfect place to take in the always impressive Sri Lankan sunsets. Make sure you're respectful when visiting; this is a working religious monument. THE DETAILS Where | Japanese Peace Pagoda , Bona Vista Rd, Unawatuna A guide to the Kandy to Ella Train #7 HANG OUT AT NEARBY SOUTHERN COAST BEACHES While not the best beach on the southern coast, Unawatuna still serves a purpose. However, if you’re keen to step a little bit outside the town, the surrounding coastline is home to a range of stunning beaches that are well worth your time. Dalawella Beach is one such beach, made famous by its incredible rock formations (and rope swing, as listed above), including frog rock, which has led to insta-fame. The beach itself is protected by an outer reef, which protects the beach from the wild Indian Ocean waves. This makes it a great place to enjoy a more relaxed beach day, and perfect for families. Flanked by beach bars and restaurants, we suggest spending an afternoon here, before enjoying dinner at Wijaya Beach Restaurant. Further afield, Mihiripenna Beach feels somewhat undiscovered, and offers endless white sand, with solid rock formations, a lagoon perfect for swimming and palm trees providing shade. Nearby Thalpe Beach and its natural pools, is also a unique place to enjoy a quick swim. If you’re feeling like a proper day trip, head to the bohemian paradise of Ahangama - the beaches are excellent, and the restaurant and bar scene is second to none. #8 PARTY ON THE BEACH Although we're not huge partygoers (we're too old you!), we did manage to spend one night out enjoying the Unawatuna nightlife at Kingfishers' notorious Saturday night beach party. With some good house music and 2-for-1 beers, we had a great little night out before retreating just after midnight. Overall, while Unawatuna is not an Ibiza-style party destination, Kingfisher Hotel is probably your best bet for a proper party, they hold their beach party every Saturday night, which fills with tourists, ex-pats and locals ready to boogie. The party doesn't kick off until 10-11 pm, so enjoy pre-drinks elsewhere before arriving. A word of warning through - the booze here is also insanely expensive - we paid more than London prices for a 330mL beer at the bar. Alternatively, The Social has live music and exceptional cocktails. We've heard of other parties occurring during the week, so it's best to ask the locals or 'beach boys' where the party is on any given night. THE DETAILS What | Kingfisher Hotel Where | Devala Road, Unawatuna Sri Lanka’s Southern Hotspot | Our Guide to Hiriketiya #9 LEARN TO SURF IN UNAWATUNA Sri Lanka is a famous surfing destination that caters to everyone, including beginners like us. One of the best things we did while travelling in the country was learning to surf, as it was cheap and warm, and the instructors were great too. While Unawatuna might not be the best place to learn on the Southern Coast, it is possible with Dewata Beach your best bet for learning. You can book surf lessons on the beach or in town. Alternatively, head south towards Dalawella, Talpe and Weligama, or north towards Hikkaduwa. Lessons range from LKR 2500 - 6000 while board hire ranges from LKR 250 - 500 per hour. The perfect three-week Sri Lanka itinerary #10 COCKTAILS, FOODIE DELIGHTS AND GOOD NIGHTS Unawatuna might be a little unfashionable these days (Ahangama is the place right now), but several restaurants are bucking the trend and enticing travellers back to this little hamlet. And Hideout is one such place. One of the best restaurants on the southern coast, Hideout serves up fresh, tasty Mexican with a Sri Lankan twist - think jackfruit BBQ tacos, grilled mahi mahi, and sharing plates, plus homemade salsas and tortillas (see menu here ). Additionally, their craft cocktails are spot on, especially in the oppressive humidity. We suggest visiting for the ever-popular Taco Tuesday and devouring the jackfruit tacos. And washing it down with a chilli passionfruit margarita. The open garden encourages share tables, so it’s also a great place to meet fellow travellers. … Formerly a sunset bar, The Social is another excellent restaurant and bar shaking up the hospitality scene in town. A post-pandemic move to a new location, plus a refocused menu highlighting Sri Lanka’s incredible local ingredients has resulted in one of the most sought-after tables in the country. You can’t miss the lemongrass fish, while the beetroot gnocchi is very agreeable. #11 GO WHALE WATCHING FROM UNAWATUNA Sri Lanka is home to an array of exceptional National Parks, which host a huge diversity of wildlife; 44 mammal species including elephants and leopards, and over 215 bird species, to be exact! For such a small country, the wealth of wildlife viewing opportunities is virtually unmatched globally. However, it’s not just on land that Sri Lanka’s wildlife viewing opportunities exist, but also in the ocean. Off the southern coast of Sri Lanka, it’s possible to observe a range of whale species, and dolphins, in their natural habitat. Between December - March, the waters of the Indian Ocean play host to migrating Blue Whales (dolphins, Bryde’s whales and sperm whales are sometimes also observed), which provide perfect whale-watching opportunities through a range of local operators. If you’re in Sri Lanka during this period, we highly recommend joining a whale-watching expedition . Tours depart from Mirissa (although hotel pick-ups can be arranged for Unawatuna), where medium-sized cruisers take to the ocean in search of these incredible creatures. This popular 4-6 hour whale watching tour is limited to a group of 40, providing greater whale viewing opportunities. The tour also includes breakfast, tea and coffee, as well as a highly trained crew and a tour. If you’re prone to motion sickness, be warned - the tours are often bumpy, so take precautions to avoid falling ill. THE DETAILS Where | Tour departs from Mirissa, Sri Lanka Book | Whale watching tour #12 SPEND A DAY EXPLORING GALLE FORT In our opinion, Galle Fort is one of the unmissable points of interest on any Sri Lankan itinerary . There’s just something about the narrow, bustling streets and crumbling colonial relics; the scent of exotic spices in the air, and the incredible tropical vibes, that we absolutely couldn’t get enough of. The UNESCO World Heritage-listed Galle Fort is home to chic boutiques, cafes and hotels, although there are still many pockets that make you feel as if you’ve time-travelled to the 1700s. There are a heap of must-sees (we've written a blog post about the best things to do in Galle Fort ) including: Galle Lighthouse Explore the exterior and interior of the Galle Fort, and visit the historical sights Enjoy excellent gelato at Isle of Gelato Shop till you drop. Galle Fort has the best shopping we encountered in all of Sri Lanka Watch the technicolour sunset from the Fort walls THE DETAILS Where | Galle Fort, Galle How to get there | By tuk-tuk from the Unawatuna, which should cost around 300r.

The colourful, bustling markets are home to some of the best fruit we’ve ever tried, and the local shopkeepers are more than willing to let you taste all types of weird and wonderful tropical fruits. Make sure you try Mangosteen, a weird lychee-type fruit that is delicious. Oh, and the pineapple... always have the pineapple. The markets are also a great place to stock up on spices and curry mix. We couldn’t resist stocking up on a dhal mix, one of our favourite Sri Lankan curries. We also met some wonderful people around the markets, who took time out of their day to show us around the area and teach us more about the local way of life.

Prices and availability here PLAN YOUR TRIP TO UNAWATUNA WHEN IS THE BEST TIME TO VISIT UNAWATUNA Anytime from October - April is a good time to visit Unawatuna, as the monsoon rains have passed and the temperatures are fairly stable. That being said, the absolute BEST time to visit is between February - April , when low rainfall and calmer seas provide the perfect weather to explore. We’ve been told to avoid visiting during early January when Sri Lankan holidays occur and Unawatuna is teeming with local tourists. HOW TO GET TO UNAWATUNA TRAIN Definitely, the most scenic way to get from Colombo to Unawatuna is via train, which runs along the palm-fringed coast for the majority of the journey. The Colombo Fort to Unwatuna train departs 3 times a day, with the earliest departure at 6:55 am and the final departure at 18:05. It takes around 2.5 - 3.5 hours. Alternatively, you could catch the train to Galle, and a local bus or tuk-tuk from Galle to Unawatuna (7kms - 300r). THE DETAILS Cost | 190r per person for 2nd class, 105r per person for 3rd class Departure Times | From Colombo Fort only: 0655, 1425, 1805 BOOK | Book your train tickets in advance here BUS If you prefer your creature comforts (air-conditioning), there’s a direct bus from Maharagama bus station (in the suburbs of Colombo) to Galle, which follows the newly completed inland highway. You’re guaranteed a seat, and the air-conditioning is a welcome relief in Sri Lanka. You can then catch a tuk-tuk (7kms - 300r) or local bus (60 - 80r) from Galle to Unawatuna. We did this many times (the fun of having to pick up a repaired drone from Colombo!) with no issue. THE DETAILS Cost | 360r - 400r per person Departure Times | Every 20 minutes from 5 am - 4:45 pm If you’re on a very tight budget, it’s also possible to take the local ", "images":

Here's Everything You Need To Know | The Common Wanderer", "publish_date": "Dec 31", "text": "Is Sri Lanka Safe for Tourists? Here's Everything You Need to Know! Asia Sri Lanka Dec 31 Written By The Common Wanderer How safe is Sri Lanka for tourists? This comprehensive guide contains absolutely everything you need to know about safety in Sri Lanka, including the historical context, common travel scams, safety on roads, advice for solo and female travellers, and much more. UPDATED - JULY 2024 We make very little secret of our love for Sri Lanka ; it’s beautiful, warm, and full of incredible delights to explore. But one of the reasons we return to the country over and over is for the wonderfully friendly and welcoming Sri Lankan people. Despite having been through a tumultuous few decades of civil war that only ended in 2009, Sri Lanka has always felt like an incredibly safe, peaceful destination for us as travellers, due in large part to the kind nature of the locals. Like many around the world, we watched in shock and horror as news began to emerge of the 2019 Easter terrorist attacks in Sri Lanka, which left 259 people dead. As further details emerged, we began to get concerned — this is a country we’ve been shouting from rooftops for people to visit over the last few years, but was Sri Lanka really as safe as we thought it was? The Covid happened, and then the 2022 riots and economic crisis. A tough few years. We began to receive emails from you guys fairly regularly, asking if we still thought Sri Lanka was safe for travellers to visit (spoiler: absolutely, unequivocally, 100% YES! ) — which is why we’ve put together this comprehensive guide to safety in Sri Lanka, based on our own travel experiences , research, and advice from our local Sri Lankan friends. In this guide, you’ll find everything a traveller needs to know about Sri Lankan travel safety, including the historical context, recent events, common travel scams, general safety tips, health advice, advice for female travellers, how to travel around the country safely, and more.

When you’re travelling somewhere unfamiliar or doing activities (e.g. surfing, paddleboarding, or taking questionable local transport) that you wouldn’t normally do, you’re naturally at more risk than usual. Overwhelmingly, we’ve found the country to be extremely safe and friendly, but that doesn’t mean that there aren’t issues with petty theft or personal safety at times. You absolutely need to have travel insurance that ensures you and your belongings are protected here.

CAR INSURANCE | Insurance4CarHire - a great annual car insurance policy SAFETY IN SRI LANKA | THE HISTORICAL CONTEXT For decades, Sri Lanka was entrenched in a bloody civil war between the military government and the Tamil Tigers, a separatist group seeking to establish their own sovereign state in the northern and eastern regions of the country. While many violent attacks occurred all over the country between 1983 - 2009, the majority of the battle raged in Sri Lanka’s predominantly Tamil north, and more than 80,000 (mostly civilian) lives were lost during the conflict. Today, both sides live relatively peacefully as they continue to rebuild and heal. But while the fighting may be over, it is still recent history and the pain of that time still runs deep. This is particularly the case in Jaffna , where bullet-ridden, bombed-out buildings and fields full of landmines still scar the landscape, so tread carefully when raising it in conversation with locals. The island has maintained relative peace and calm until the Easter Terrorist attacks by Islamic militants in April 2019 which killed over 250 people, and recent elections of the Sinhalese-Buddhist majority government with wartime defence chief Rajapaksa coming to power. This has simmered tensions amongst the Tamils, and Muslim minorities. While he won based on a mandate of strong security, it remains to be seen what the future will hold, but since the election things have remained relatively peaceful in the country. In 2022, the country experienced significant riots as a result of a severe economic crisis , which led to widespread shortages of essential goods, fuel, and skyrocketing inflation. Driven by public outrage over Government mismanagement and corruption, mass protests broke out, some of which turned violent. These scenes were beamed around the world and led to a steep decline in tourism, which exacerbated the economic crisis, and led to further unrest within parts of the country. Thankfully, the situation has since stabilised, with loans from the IMF, a change in Government, and increased tourism helping the country rebound. TRAVEL SAFETY IN SRI LANKA | THE STATISTICS By and large, Sri Lanka is super safe, particularly for travellers. The homicide rates are low, around 2.3%. In comparison, America is around 5%, while most European countries are less than 1%. Most homicides involve local gangs or domestic violence, so attacks against travellers are extremely uncommon. While terrorism has been a concern in the recent past, it's worth noting there hadn’t been a terrorist attack for over 10 years, until the April 2019 attack. Although extremist militant groups may slowly be increasing their tentacles into the country (as with many destinations globally), the government and its military are extremely heavy - handed and civil control remains tight. Like anywhere in the world, do your research, keep your wits about you, and don't take unnecessary risks. For travellers, check the advice on your country’s travel website for their recommendations: United Kingdom Australia USA Canada HOW TO STAY SAFE IN SRI LANKA TAKE NORMAL TRAVEL SAFETY PRECAUTIONS Overwhelmingly, after 6 weeks and multiple trips to Sri Lanka we’ve always been struck by just how friendly, safe, and welcoming the country is. In our view, you’re more likely to be bowled over by people’s genuine warmth than any negative interactions. That said, like anywhere in the world, tourists can sometimes be seen as easy targets. Staying safe here is all about being aware of your surroundings and staying alert. Petty theft is the most common safety issue to be aware of, so always be mindful of your belongings and don’t leave your things unattended. Also, be aware that pickpockets can operate in major cities and around tourist attractions. Always be aware of your surroundings, and if you get that prickly feeling that something just 'isn't right'; listen to it, and move yourself or your belongings to a safer place. Always consider the following: Only take a day's worth of money out with you at one time Be aware of your surroundings when taking money out at an ATM. If something seems suspicious, move along quickly Leave the jewellery at home, you really won’t need it here and it acts as a beacon for any potential thief Be discreet with your camera, especially large DSLR’s. Keep it locked in a backpack until you need it, or keep it securely in your hands Don’t walk the streets at night by yourself, especially in larger cities or towns Pickpockets exist here as they do everywhere, so if you’re visiting markets, bazaars, train or bus stations or even walking the streets, just be extra careful RELATED | 39 Essential Sri Lanka travel tips COMMON TRAVEL SCAMS IN SRI LANKA Beyond a couple of tuk-tuk drivers trying their luck, we’ve barely encountered any real scams or safety concerns on either of our trips, but here are a few things to watch out for just in case: TUK TUK SCAMS | Like most places around the world, the most common scam in Sri Lanka involves tuk-tuk overcharging. While most drivers are decent people who offer a fair service, some, particularly those waiting out the front of major tourist points or train stations (Colombo Fort being one in particular), are more of your tuk-tuk mafia inclination, and will demand grossly overpriced fees while behaving particularly aggressively. In cities, only take tuk-tuks that have meters, and request that they’re turned on prior to getting into the vehicle. In other areas, be sure to clearly agree on a set price before getting into the tuk-tuk. Alternatively, use apps like PickMe (basically the Uber of the tuk-tuk world here!) to avoid any issues. In other instances, tuk-tuk drivers may also insist on taking you to their ‘friend’s cinnamon/herbal/gemstone shop’ as part of a ‘tour’. Politely but firmly decline, as this is purely to earn a commission from whatever you may purchase. CLOSED HOTEL/RESTAURANT/ATTRACTION | Another one that tends to be the remit of tuk-tuk drivers, where you’ll be informed that the place you want to visit is closed, but they can take you to a different hotel/restaurant/attraction (generally for an exorbitant price). Always know the opening hours of your intended destinations, and if in doubt, call your hotel straightaway! PICKPOCKETING | As with most destinations, there is a risk of pickpocketing, particularly in crowded areas like Pettah market in Colombo. Try not to flash your expensive items, and avoid putting your valuables in your pockets or easily accessible areas of your bags. STILT FISHERMAN | There’s no image more iconic in Sri Lanka than the stilt fisherman, expertly balancing on two strapped-together sticks in the shallows of the southern coastline, fishing for the day’s catch. While a small handful do genuinely practice this traditional fishing method (most prefer boat fishing now), there are also plenty of unscrupulous non-fishermen who partner with men on the beach to demand payment once you’ve snapped your winning picture. MILK POWDER SCAM | A scam common to much of Asia that seems to be making its way to Sri Lanka. Read more about it here , but in short, do not purchase baby formula or milk powder for anyone on your travels, no matter how convincing their story may be. PUBLIC TRANSPORT SAFETY IN SRI LANKA Public transport in Sri Lanka is both a blessing and a nightmare. On one hand, you have some of the most epic railway journeys anywhere in the world, including the epic Kandy to Ella train ride, and the southern coastal express from Colombo to Galle (and beyond). Travelling by bus is a whole level of authenticity in Sri Lanka , with blaring music, flashing lights, and friendly locals making the journey thoroughly enjoyable. And tuk tuks are always fun! But there are a few dangers to be aware of. TRAIN SAFETY IN SRI LANKA While Sri Lankan trains are amazing and generally very safe, tourists and Instagrammers alike have taken to hanging as far out of the doors as possible with their partner to snap the ‘perfect’ shot, particularly on the Kandy to Ella train. In the spirit of full transparency, we have sat on the footboards and leaned slightly out of this train before (when it was barely moving, and in extremely safe conditions). Hanging out of doorways, endangering the lives of yourself, your travel buddies, or the locals who take the train is simply not okay. What’s more, some of the best experiences can be found inside the train, not snapping an insta banger. As always, be careful of your belongings on train journeys, and always watch your bags. Overwhelmingly though, our train journeys have been the most enjoyable part of our travels in Sri Lanka. READ MORE | Our complete Kandy to Ella train guide BUS SAFETY IN SRI LANKA And then there are the buses. The crazy, chaotic buses. We kinda love them, as they give you such a true Sri Lankan experience - loud music, tight confines, and friendly locals give you an authentic experience unlike anywhere else. BUT they’re not overly safe or well-maintained, and they’re driven by drivers intent on speeding everywhere. And there’s generally no safety protection, especially if you’re required to stand for periods. There’s not much you can do about it apart from embracing it, but if you’d prefer to not put yourself in a position of potential danger, steer clear. TUK TUK SAFETY IN SRI LANKA Tuk tuks are, of course, synonymous with Sri Lanka, and while we’ve never had any issues with them we’ve seen minor accidents involving one or more sometimes, especially in Colombo or Kandy . Again, there’s not a huge amount you can control, but if you feel uncomfortable with the speed or driving, make your driver aware and ask them to slow down/drive less recklessly. Don’t use tuk-tuks without meters in cities, and if you’re travelling rurally, some drivers are known to charge far higher fees and be overly aggressive to secure your business. Try to ask a local about costs before arriving at your destination (most will be happy to help), so you have an idea of what costs to expect. If the driver becomes belligerent, simply walk away and don’t engage. IS SRI LANKA SAFE FOR FEMALE TRAVELLERS? We have to say upfront that we travel as a couple, but for our female readers who are travelling alone, Sri Lanka is, by and large, safe for female travellers. It’s important to know that Sri Lanka is still a very conservative, patriarchal culture and that you will need to keep this in mind when travelling here. Take the usual precautions you would anywhere in the world: avoid travelling alone at night, buddy up where possible, and keep your wits about you when drinking, etc. Whether you like it or not, you will need to dress modestly on your travels here, particularly in Colombo. Most beach and tourist areas are fine with shorts and t-shirts (don’t wear your bikinis around town!), but Mim did find that she got a little unwanted attention (staring) when wearing loose-fitting shorts in more conservative Colombo. Think below knees and covered shoulders. We never experienced anything of the like, but harassment, ranging from sexually suggestive comments to physical advances and sexual assaults - can and do occur sometimes. These are most frequent in crowded areas such as marketplaces, railway stations, buses, or public streets, but it’s nowhere near as intense as in places like India. If you do feel uncomfortable at any point, seek out other travellers or local women/families for help or company. NOTE | The Sri Lankan authorities have installed a special number (dial 1938) to report sexual harassment. HEALTH SAFETY IN SRI LANKA | MEDICAL MATTERS While the below might look a little worrying, most travellers won’t experience any health issues beyond a case of Traveller’s Belly (and to be honest, we haven’t even had this on two trips there!). Here’s what to look out for health-wise in Sri Lanka: VACCINATIONS + GENERAL HEALTH WHO recommends that travellers to Sri Lanka have the following vaccinations up to date: Hepatitis A, Hepatitis B, Typhoid, Yellow Fever, Japanese Encephalitis, Rabies (there are several stray dogs), MMR, and Tetanus/Diptheria. Most travellers will have had some of these throughout their lives already, so it’s worth checking with your doctor for what you might need before you go. For those travelling with children under the age of five, we suggest speaking with your physician before travelling to the country. KNOW YOUR NEAREST HOSPITAL, ESPECIALLY IF TRAVELLING WITH CHILDREN Prior to travelling with children, we were carefree and barely considered our health and well-being, beyond the most basic of travel insurance and taking general precautions. Aware that travel with children is a different beast, before our recent trip to Sri Lanka, we mapped out and saved local hospitals in each destination we visited, just in case something were to happen - that way we would have peace of mind knowing a hospital was close by. And sure enough, our daughter suffered a severe allergic reaction (more on that below), and we had to rush to Galle Hospital to receive medical attention. Thankfully she was fine, but as a result, we now suggest adding hospitals and medical centres to Google Maps before you arrive. And learning the local emergency service number, which in Sri Lanka’s case, is 110. BRING YOUR VITAL MEDICATIONS FROM HOME We discovered just how strict Sri Lanka’s medication governance is when Mark had an eye infection and we needed to buy some eye drops from the Pharmacy. Given these are pretty standard over-the-counter products back home, we assumed there’d be no issue picking some up here too. Wrong! In Sri Lanka, you need a doctor’s prescription for just about everything, and we couldn’t even buy eye drops without visiting the doctor first (and of course, they’d all just shut for the day too!). If there are items you might need during your trip, like antibiotics, anti-inflammatories or painkillers, eye drops, etc - be sure to pack enough from home to avoid any hassles during your trip. FOOD SAFETY IN SRI LANKA The food in Sri Lanka is insanely good (honestly, it’s one of our favourite cuisines!), but food hygiene can sometimes leave a bit to be desired. If you were going to get sick in Sri Lanka, this is likely how it’ll happen! To avoid getting Traveller’s Belly, we recommend: Eat at busy restaurants or cafes where the food is being turned over quickly Make sure your food is cooked fresh if being purchased from a stall Ensure your meals are properly cooked Avoid ice cubes (although most restaurants and cafes today purchase cubes made with safe drinking water) In addition to the above, those with allergies must take extreme caution in the country. We encountered a severe allergic episode with our toddler, who unbeknownst to us, ended up consuming cashews in a sauce while staying in Ahangama. While we had antihistamine on hand, we had to race to a hospital in Galle to alleviate any further issues. It was one of the scariest moments of our lives, and one we don’t wish upon anyone. Sri Lankan cuisine is known to use quite a few allergens, including various nuts, seafood and dairy products. If you have an allergy, enquire about the ingredients before you eat anything, and make sure you carry an antihistamine or EpiPen (if required) wherever you go. USE A WATER PURIFICATION BOTTLE FOR WATER The tap water in Sri Lanka isn’t safe for drinking, but that absolutely doesn’t mean you need to buy plastic bottled water. Seriously, there is no need for a modern human to still be buying bottled water. Travel with a water purification system (we recently switched to The Grayl after using Water to Go for about a year), and you can fill up directly from the tap, purify your water and filter out any nasties, and drink with confidence. Seriously, it’s the BEST investment we’ve ever made for our travels - we haven’t bought bottled water in over five years, and have drunk tap water in India, Nepal, and Sri Lanka, and despite travelling through some places with very questionable water (Sri Lanka included), we’re yet to encounter a single tummy bug. Not a single one! We recommend grabbing one for yourself before visiting Sri Lanka, and you’ll stay hydrated wherever you are. BUY | The Grayl GEOPRESS water purification and filtration bottles PREPARE FOR THE HEAT AND HUMIDITY Sri Lanka is hot. Really hot. Even as warm-blooded Aussies, we struggled during our first trip to the country. Simply put, you’ve got to keep your fluids up, especially when out exploring (or climbing Sigiriya…!). Avoid exploring during the midday heat, and always use sunscreen no matter what time of da", "images": ["https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5a3bb03b4c326d76de73ddaa/7e8c249c-47ce-4580-abd7-dde557079944/The_Common_Wanderer_-1077.jpg", "https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5a3bb03b4c326d76de73ddaa/1721974344047-L5MFERSZMTDSEK4EZ3AP/The_Common_Wanderer_-42.jpg", "https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5a3bb03b4c326d76de73ddaa/1721974344286-22B7LQ167PJBME1RFWMF/The_Common_Wanderer_-174.jpg", "https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5a3bb03b4c326d76de73ddaa/1721974254455-ZQDW5XJXIJVDTDWWFS2H/The_Common_Wanderer_-144.jpg", "https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5a3bb03b4c326d76de73ddaa/1721974254654-KX36IM11NP81XOWSL7SY/The_Common_Wanderer_-623.jpg", "https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5a3bb03b4c326d76de73ddaa/1721974134180-YZ1MC7LMDN7UM2JCSAV1/The_Common_Wanderer_-112.jpg", "https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5a3bb03b4c326d76de73ddaa/1721974134386-XCKK3F6TL6H1IU4ZV7QJ/The_Common_Wanderer_-141.jpg", "https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5a3bb03b4c326d76de73ddaa/1721974076235-IK9AGBTH1WA4I0MBT3N1/The_Common_Wanderer_-140.jpg", "https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5a3bb03b4c326d76de73ddaa/1721974076235-RE6AV1Y859PUAA3Q0LJ8/The_Common_Wanderer_-1060.jpg", "https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5a3bb03b4c326d76de73ddaa/1721974030193-EWSFA0JSUKODSIN7ENF6/The_Common_Wanderer_-461.jpg", "https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5a3bb03b4c326d76de73ddaa/1721974030390-SX1R9SF6J6IZXVCGI2Y5/The_Common_Wanderer_-361.jpg", "https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5a3bb03b4c326d76de73ddaa/1721973958780-M9TIABUDQK0E0AJ36FJE/The_Common_Wanderer_-150.jpg", "https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5a3bb03b4c326d76de73ddaa/1721973958950-QAHAXNVG1K96D593E4BB/The_Common_Wanderer_-205-2.jpg", "https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5a3bb03b4c326d76de73ddaa/1721973552957-6AADF6QXB6YVB2NI0ZPA/The_Common_Wanderer_-47.jpg", "https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5a3bb03b4c326d76de73ddaa/1721973552957-RHR1UV22I8TQFC7J4C3T/The_Common_Wanderer_-168.jpg", "https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5a3bb03b4c326d76de73ddaa/1721973908140-ZN21KKX9YNLVYREDON80/The_Common_Wanderer_-503.jpg", "https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5a3bb03b4c326d76de73ddaa/1721973908140-7X11ZUVSEYJ33M5R4WLF/The_Common_Wanderer_-272.jpg", "https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5a3bb03b4c326d76de73ddaa/1754377570264-LFZYWYUHWS2C8LHBO77I/The_Common_Wanderer_-2.jpg", "https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5a3bb03b4c326d76de73ddaa/1734411155344-PZ7AF1XZ7U4B9CGNI0FQ/The_Common_Wanderer_-498+%281%29.jpg", "https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5a3bb03b4c326d76de73ddaa/1731649288111-MDL4G4863I6IW1T7EUEJ/The_Common_Wanderer_-502+%281%29.jpg", "https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5a3bb03b4c326d76de73ddaa/1721277162374-NZH5HA2ZCKXVMIQN8ZRU/The_Common_Wanderer_-33-2.jpg", "https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5a3bb03b4c326d76de73ddaa/1675246805540-7WNC2K7WA0RLYFQQWS4R/The_Common_Wanderer_-9166-2.jpg", "https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5a3bb03b4c326d76de73ddaa/1670900362617-F50ZROC1WJIOXUMFKGYX/The+Common+Wanderer-6499+%283%29.jpg", "https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5a3bb03b4c326d76de73ddaa/1721969731038-N6MQYB7AIDI6QSOPX4L6/The_Common_Wanderer_-230-2+%282%29.jpg", "https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5a3bb03b4c326d76de73ddaa/1675503351527-YC18BYNS8NWMJVW71GTD/The+Common+Wanderer-9897-4+%281%29.jpg", "https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5a3bb03b4c326d76de73ddaa/1712815660165-AP22GVVWJFN9DAGAA76S/The_Common_Wanderer_-119+%281%29.jpg", "https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5a3bb03b4c326d76de73ddaa/1721870846834-RW5VDH1VDJ2GCQGZNP5W/The_Common_Wanderer_-4528.jpg", "https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5a3bb03b4c326d76de73ddaa/1704417357111-61RPMBIZZKETYS3DG25M/The+Common+Wanderer-133-2.jpg", "https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5a3bb03b4c326d76de73ddaa/1721283300176-WNANJDX78R3AUNQ6RTLQ/The_Common_Wanderer_-146.jpg", "https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v2/namespaces/memberAccountAvatars/libraries/59b1acb3f5e231475663379e/c7ace3d6aaf04874890a308cf8605f3b/c7ace3d6aaf04874890a308cf8605f3b.jpeg?format=300w"]}

Our review of this luxurious, environmentally-friendly oasis on the shores of Koggala Lake, in southern Sri Lanka. Flustered, hot, and with dust smeared across our clothes and faces as the two of us (and our backpacks) tumbled out of our tuk tuk: we definitely weren’t in the business of great first impressions when we first arrived at the gates of Tri Lanka, a luxurious sustainable retreat on the shores of Sri Lanka ’s Koggala Lake. Our journey from the white sand beaches of Unawatuna had been somewhat of a jarring one, as we lurched to-and-fro on a maniacal local bus with hot pink furry steering wheel covers, before another bumpy tuk tuk ride through rice paddies and over unusually steep dirt roads. But none of that mattered now; within seconds our weighty backpacks had been whisked away before we’d had a chance to notice. Glasses full of iced tea had been pressed into our hands. Cold towels were laid on the table, to refresh our hands and faces in seconds. As we sank into the chaise lounge on the deck overlooking the infinity pool, and watched the sun dip behind the calm waters of the lake below, the troubles of five minutes ago already seemed worlds away. In fact, every stress or fatigue that our last few months on the road had brought seemed to melt away, such was the tranquility of the entire scene. Within these first few minutes of our 2-night stay, we already knew exactly why this contemporary, sustainably-minded hotel had fast become one of Sri Lanka ’s most-wanted luxury hotel stays. This is why. LOVE OUR PHOTOS?

ABOUT TRI HOTEL, KOGGALA Tri’s manager, Oli, puts it best when talking about Tri: it’s a destination within a destination. In fact, of all the views he’s seen in his extensive travels all over the country, this view over Koggala Lake is his absolute favourite. Owners Rob Drummond and wife Lara Baumann Drummond bought the land in 2003 , with a vision to transform this former cinnamon plantation into Sri Lanka’s first truly contemporary sustainable luxury design hotel. Want to book a stay at Tri Hotel ? Check prices and availability here Construction took two years (during which no trees were cut down or damaged on the property!), and the end result is the Tri of today: “a masterpiece of forward-thinking flair where mathematical marries artistic, and intelligence embraces emotion”. Proximity to nature is what underpins everything at Tri; from the construction of the resort to its food, the wellness sanctuary vibes to the activities on offer (more on all this below!). Spa treatments, Quantum Yoga sessions, and the tastiest of dining are just a few of Tri’s many, many perks - while the atmosphere is peaceful in a way that you feel like you’re walking through a constant meditation session. This is the kind of place that attracts certain types of travellers; those looking for digital detox and inspiration will find themselves rejuvenated. Couples seeking romance will discover a tranquil hideaway. Nature lovers will find the hotel’s wildlife-filled location awe-inspiring. No matter what brings you here, to begin with, there’s no doubt that this is an ultra-inspiring setting for the mind, body, and soul. TRI’S LOCATION | THE BEAUTIFUL KOGGALA LAKE Despite feeling as though you’ve travelled for days to a secret hideaway in a remote jungle, Tri is actually super close to the energy of the southern coastline and only 20 minutes by tuk tuk from the boho bustle of cosmopolitan Galle Fort. Given that so many travellers to the south of Sri Lanka don’t stray far from the beaches of the coastline - except for a quick ride on the famous blue train to Ella, it’s nice to see Tri encouraging people to venture further inland. The Koggala Lake area is rich in both biodiversity and culture; the kind of place where you can discover wildlife and an untouched natural oasis, alongside a charming Buddhist temple or generations-old Cinnamon farm. The perfect base to get to know a totally different side of Sri Lanka! The ultimate sri lanka bucket list | 31 incredible things to do in sri lanka TRI HOTEL | A COMMITMENT TO SUSTAINABILITY “ Guided by nature, evolved by aesthetic passion, and fortified by an all-encompassing sustainable philosophy. ” — Tri Lanka We’ll wager that many people view ‘sustainability’ or ‘green travel’ as the remit of the shaggy-haired, hemp-wearing hippie smoking pot and telling anyone who’ll listen about their life-changing spiritual experience at an ashram in Rishikesh. Sadly, sustainable travel is still widely seen as something of a radical idea, one that requires giving up comfort and mod-cons in favour of wooden huts and not washing for days. This is exactly where Tri is turning the image of sustainability on its head, by marrying conscious travel and blissful luxury together with ease. There are all the technical ways in which they’re sustainable - working with Colombo-based green consultancy to continually reduce their carbon footprint; harvesting natural + solar power; resource consumption monitoring; reversing habitat degradation and undertaking mangrove planting programs to reduce shoreline erosion - but what we loved the most about Tri during our stay was the feeling that ‘local-first’ was the thought that underpinned every element of the hotel. From the 100% recycled local timber and Sri Lankan granite to the brilliant locally employed staff and the gourmet feasts created from the freshest of fresh produce (with bamboo straws to boot!), unlike many expat-led accommodation options in Sri Lanka, Tri is clearly integrating and empowering local communities from within, one of our favourite things to see on the road. TRI HOTEL KOGGALA | PHILOSOPHY + DESIGN Sitting by the main deck, looking out over * that * infinity pool (an insta-famous Sri Lankan spot in its own right!), Oli revealed to us that Tri’s founder, Rob, is a photographer - and it’s obvious. On an island where the landscape is characterised by charming, yes, but repetitive sprawling Colonial mansions-turned-hotels, Tri is a refreshingly modern masterpiece of cool glass and contemporary open plan style. Every angle is a masterpiece, and we found it almost impossible to put down our cameras the entire time we were there. But don’t let the high ceilings and clean lines fool you; everything about Tri is designed to be in, and of, the nature that surrounds it. It’s a philosophy that underpins absolutely every element of the hotel, from its very construction and design right through to the food served on its tables and the Yoga taught in its (very zen) Yoga Shala. Just wandering the paths around Tri brought us a sense of calm that felt truly innate, and it wasn’t until we discovered that the resort follows one of nature’s greatest equations, the golden ratio (also known as the Fibonacci sequence), that we understood why. This ‘divine’ ratio (1:1.61 to be exact!) is replicated over and over in the natural world, from flower petals to DNA molecules and even the shape of our universe. But its beauty lies in the fact that it’s also the most aesthetically pleasing and calming structure in our world - so it’s little wonder that the structures that makeup Tri follow this ratio too, unfurling in a shell-like spiral pattern from the most glorious old Banyan tree that towers over the heart of the property. Looking back at Tri from the quiet of Koggala Lake, the buildings retreat away into the green so beautifully that you’d almost miss the hotel entirely if you didn’t know it was there. The rooftop of our villa was planted with living gardens, buildings (including the functioning water tower!) are encircled by cinnamon bark, and the whole site is alive with tea plants, bamboo, edible gardens, and the sound of nesting birds. The glass-walled library makes you feel like you’re curled up on the branch of a tree, which is Mim’s dream! Book your stay at Tri Lanka here TRI HOTEL | THE ROOMS Our first thought upon entering our villa at Tri was “We are WAY too dusty/sweaty/gross to deserve this room right now”. Our second (in case you were wondering!) was ‘this is, without doubt, the most beautiful hotel room we’ll ever call home’. Tri’s. rooms. are. divine. In fact, we’re actually doing them a disservice by calling them rooms; most of the sleeping quarters at Tri are actually standalone villas tucked away into quiet, lush little pockets of the jungle, with sunset views out over beautifully calm Koggala Lake. There are also three rooms in the water tower, which we can only imagine grant epic views over the area. The rooms are minimalist, which only enhances the ‘back to nature’ vibe of the place, and one of the largest, comfiest beds we’ve had the pleasure of laying our heads on. There are no screens here, but more than enough beauty in the view outside your balcony to keep you entertained! We loved the little touches, like the glass bottle of drinking water, lemongrass solid hand soap bar, and the jar of snacks that were refilled each day.

No place is this more evident than in the dining room! Tri operates on a half-board basis, which means that your breakfast and dinner are included each day. We’re talking 6-course, beautifully-prepared, super healthy and nourishing gourmet feasts that are a fusion of local and international styles. Vegetarians are beautifully catered for too, and the staff were super attentive to what we liked/didn’t like. We ate so much food each day (and in fact, breakfast was enough to keep us going all day till dinner), yet left the hotel feeling healthier than ever. We also loved the fact that, in this age of overconsumption and over-stocked buffets (where there’s enough food to feed a village and much of it is thrown in the trash after), breakfast is served as per mostly-set menu, with limited (yet delicious!) breakfast choices. It’s great to see a luxurious hotel pushing back against that ‘everything, all at once’ mentality that so many other 5-star providers seem to have. TRI HOTEL | THE FACILITIES AND ACTIVITIES Tri is one of those places where you can do as much, or as little, as your body wants you to - and there’s no one judging you either way. For a start, you could take a Quantum Yoga class - Tri co-founder, Lara Baumann is the founder of this unique Yoga style - in the tranquillity of the treehouse-like yoga shala, or enjoy an Ayurvedic massage treatment, then let your worries drift away by the pool for the rest of the day. There’s also space for quiet reading time in the glass-walled library that seriously makes you feel as though you’re at one with the jungle around you, and, if you’re feeling thirsty, venturing up to the top floor of the water tower will reward you with an epic sundowner. While Tri is definitely a destination within a destination, there’s also plenty to do outside the hotel walls if you’re feeling inclined. One day, we took a boat ride across the lake to Cinnamon Island, where local Sarath and his family have been farming cinnamon for a couple of generations. We sipped cinnamon tea while Sarath showed us exactly how the cinnamon is extracted and ground down. We also left with the most delicious-smelling bag of fresh, organic cinnamon straight from the source - what more could you want?! On another afternoon, we decided to stretch our legs and cycled through the tiny villages and scenic rice paddies around Koggala Lake with Oli, the General Manager. There are some beautiful trails around the property and it was a really authentic insight into exactly what life is like around this beautiful lake. Oli is an absolute wealth of knowledge when it comes to the local flora and fauna, so we definitely recommend using him as your guide (although it is possible to head out for a cycle solo if that takes your fancy instead). If you’re keen to venture a little further, the Handunugoda Tea Estate (Herman Teas) in the hills above Koggala is famous for its virgin white tea and also provides free tours of its tea plantation.

Book your stay at Tri Lanka here THINGS TO KNOW BEFORE STAYING AT TRI HOTEL YOU CAN’T SWIM IN THE LAKE Inviting though it looks, Koggala Lake is a no-swim zone, thanks to the crocodiles that call it home. You’ll have to make do with the epic infinity pool instead… shame! THERE IS NO NIGHTLIFE HERE This is probably already pretty obvious, but if you’re looking for pumping nightlife or vibrant streets on your doorstep, Tri isn’t the place you’re after. Fall asleep to the sounds of the lake and its insects, and wake to the first rays of light instead! BRING YOUR BINOCULARS There are plenty of wildlife-viewing opportunities everywhere you look. Pack a pair of binoculars and spend an afternoon spotting the rich wildlife around the resort. colonial charms | things to do in galle fort, a short drive from tri hotel HOW TO GET TO TRI, SRI LANKA Despite feeling like a secret hideaway, Tri is super well-connected to the rest of Sri Lanka . There are a few ways to get to the resort, including: BY CAR If you’re travelling by car or private transport, Tri is just a 15-minute drive away from the Matara airport highway and then just 2-2.5 hours to/from Colombo International Airport (Bandaranaike International Airport). BY PLANE If you like your hotel transfers a little more ‘Bond-esque’, another way to get to Tri Hotel is via their scheduled flights and bespoke charters on their seaplane service to Koggala Lake from most parts of Sri Lanka, including the main airport and the hill country too. BY TRAIN For intrepid travellers seeking adventure, the journey can be made via train to Galle then a connection to Koggala where there’s a smaller village station. From there, jump in a tuk-tuk to Tri, which should only take 10 or so minutes. BY BOAT For a more traditional arrival, Tri’s dhoni boat (operated by the former owner of the plantation!) is available to collect you from the main road or from Koggala airbase (for those arriving by plane) and transport you directly onto the private jetty in front of the restaurant and infinity pool. sri lanka’s capital of culture | a traveller’s guide to kandy, sri lanka BEST TIME TO VISIT TRI LANKA As Tri is based on the Southern coastline of Sri Lanka , your best (driest) travel times are generally from December to April, when the days are a little cooler, and the humidity isn’t peaking yet. We stayed at Tri in mid-November, and while the days were quite pleasant, the afternoons generally brought a heavy storm (which can be brilliant to watch as they roll across the lake!). If you’re keen to avoid the crowds of peak season, June/July and Oct/Nov (the monsoon shoulder months) are your best bet, as the days are less likely to bring constant torrential downpours.

Here’s everything you need to know for your visit. UPDATED - July 2024 If there’s a more beautiful scene than Sri Lanka ’s Nine Arch Bridge, we’re definitely yet to witness it for ourselves. Flanked by thick jungle and tea plantations; this stone bridge stands proudly across a lush green gorge in the hill country just outside Ella . Calling it picturesque would almost be a disservice, particularly on a misty day when cloud hangs low in the valley, and the famous blue train passes slowly over the bridge, creating a moody, mystical, captivating scene. But we have a little confession to make. When we first visited Sri Lanka in 2016, we spotted a few images of this (then) little-known bridge online. It looked like a photographer’s paradise, and it instantly went to the top of our Sri Lankan bucket list . When the day finally came to visit, we were awake before the sun and bouncing off the walls with eager anticipation. We practically speed walked to what we thought was the entry point, made our way along the path, and then…. well… we got lost. Horribly lost. We’re still not quite sure how it happened, but no matter which path we tried to take, we just never seemed to get any closer to our goal. Worst of all? We could see the arches, we just couldn’t work out how to get there. They seemed to beckon us mockingly as we became more and more frustrated with our predicament. Eventually, we gave up and went back to our Airbnb, disappointed and a tad embarrassed about our navigational failings. Since then, the Nine Arch Bridge has exploded onto the scene as one of Ella’s most visited attractions , and after revisiting it again late last year, we can happily confirm that the path (or multiple paths!) is incredibly easy to find now too! To help you have the best time ever (and avoid the mistakes we made), we’ve put together this guide to absolutely everything you need to know about visiting the Nine Arch Bridge. Enjoy!

In fact, the story goes that not long after the bridge had been commissioned by the British, WWI broke out between Europe’s Empires. When the steel allocated to this bridge was redirected to Britain’s war efforts, a team of Sri Lankan engineers and builders completed the job in 1921 using blocks of stone and cement. To this day, the 91m long, 24m high bridge has stood entirely without steel support, and we think it’s a pretty damn good example of human ingenuity! Today, the bridge is famous amongst travellers and locals alike, who come to catch a glimpse of the famous blue train slowly inching its way across the bridge. One of the things we love best about that moment is just how jovial it all is; those on the train smile and wave, and those on the ground often cheer with excitement. It’s impossible not to be swept up in the atmosphere of it all! adventures in the hill country: our guide to ella, sri lanka HOW TO GET TO THE NINE ARCH BRIDGE There are a few ways to get to Nine Arch Bridge from Ella, and each depends on your budget, mobility, and time: TUK-TUK FROM ELLA TOWN You can take a tuk-tuk from Ella town to the Nine Arch Bridge parking spot , then hike the remaining 5-10 minutes on foot, which was the quickest and easiest option. Tuk tuks cost about LKR 2-300 for this. ON FOOT You can also walk to Nine Arch Bridge by following the Ella-Passara Road, turning left at Sri Kanaser Temple (where all the street food stalls are) and following the signs past multiple guesthouses until you arrive at the bridge. Alternatively, you can follow the train tracks from Ella town all the way to the bridge. This is a cool option as it passes the smaller three-arch bridge on the way. Bring water. TUK-TUK DOWN TO THE BRIDGE There is the option to catch a tuk-tuk right down to the bridge itself (rather than walk the remainder), however, we heard rumours during our time there that a few unscrupulous drivers have been scamming tourists by taking them on a long-winded journey and then charging them extra. BOOK | This highly-rated tour takes you on a guided tour of the Nine Arch Bridge and Little Adams Peak WHEN TO VISIT THE NINE ARCH BRIDGE There are two key times to visit the Nine Arch Bridge both for the best experience and perfect photographs: sunrise and when the train is crossing it. Sunrise is a magical time here, as the tracks are bathed in golden light (perfect for photography - read our top photography tips here!) and there’s barely another soul in sight. You’ll have the joy of watching the surrounding hills come to life and snapping some epic shots without having to contend with a million selfie sticks at the same time. By about 7 am the crowds are already starting to gather, and by the time 10 am rolls around, the masses have well and truly descended. The other key time is, obviously, as one of the famous trains crosses the bridge; a dash of blue through the lush green hills. We’ve listed the times of when the train is scheduled to pass over the bridge below, however, the Sri Lankan train network is notoriously unreliable - so allocate some extra time on either side! Trains pass over the bridge at the following times: 9:30 11:30 15:30 16:30 17:30 If you can, we’d suggest visiting Ella and the Nine Arch Bridge during January - May, when the weather is slightly warmer and the chance of rain is at its lowest. It's also peak season for tourists, which can make the town and its attractions feel a little crowded. We’d avoid visiting between September to December, which is the wet season. DIYALUMA FALLS | a guide to Sri Lanka’s second-tallest waterfall THE BEST VIEWPOINTS OF NINE ARCH BRIDGE Depending on how much exploring you’re willing to do in the hills on either side of the bridge, there are plenty of awesome viewpoints (and photography angles!) over the curved train track and misty slopes - although there are a few easy ones we’d recommend checking out: THE BRIDGE ITSELF The most popular of the viewpoints are from the bridge itself - though we do have to warn you that it’s still part of the working (and famous!) train line between Kandy and Bandarawela via Ella, so do be careful when you’re on the tracks! THE TEA FIELDS TOWARDS DEMODARA On the northern end of the bridge (away from the tunnel), there are some tea fields below the bridge that are popular for photography, particularly for shooting up to the bridge from below. These are steep, muddy (read: full of leeches!) and technically private land, so be sure to ask the workers who work in them before traipsing through. THE HILLS TOWARDS ELLA STATION Head towards the tunnel at one end of the bridge (towards Ella), and take the path to the left. This winds up through the forested hills on that side, eventually coming to a clearing with perfect views over the tracks below. Photography-wise, this will give you a lovely shot of the bridge as it curves away from the camera. THE ASANKA CAFE VIEWPOINT Perched high above on the northern end of the bridge, the Asanka Cafe is probably the best spot to view the Nine Arch Bridge from. Our favourite shot of the foggy mountains and blue train is from this very spot! From here, you can see the full curve of the track and the train as it emerges from the tunnel. The family who owns the cafe is absolutely lovely, and they make a delicious cup of sweet tea (perfect if you get stuck in a torrential downpour, as we did!). THE FORESTED HILLS ABOVE THE BRIDGE Another great lookout over the tracks can be found on the same side as the Asanka Cafe, simply walk along the track to the right, (away from the tunnel) and then hike up on the path found on your right-hand side. ELLA ACCOMODATION: The best places to stay in Ella TIPS & FAQS FOR VISITING THE NINE ARCH BRIDGE LISTEN OUT FOR THE TRAIN HORN As we’ve mentioned, this is very much a working train bridge, so if you plan to explore or take photos on the bridge or its surrounds, listen out for the train horn and make sure you’re well out of the way with plenty of time. THERE ARE PLENTY OF CAFES If you’ve been exploring on an empty tummy or you get stuck in a rainstorm (as we did), there are a couple of cafes both along the hiking path and down next to the bridge to sit and grab some food, a warm tea, or just relax and take it all in from. PICK UP YOUR RUBBISH There’s nothing worse than arriving at such a beautiful scene, only to find bits of rubbish and plastic littered about next to the tracks. Don’t be a gross human; avoid buying plastic where you can, and if you do, please take your trash out of the area with you until you can find a suitable place to dispose of it. SAFETY AT NINE ARCH BRIDGE, SRI LANKA Overwhelmingly, we’ve found Ella to be extremely safe, much like the rest of Sri Lanka, however, the Nine Arch Bridge can be a little unsafe if you don’t keep your wits about you. Firstly, it’s a live train line, and upwards of 10 trains pass during the day. Therefore, it’s important to clear the tracks at the first sign of a train. Generally, there’ll be a horn, so listen out. Secondly, the bridge has no safety barriers. Now, this is simultaneously wonderful, as it gives you the freedom to enjoy the bridge in all its glory and a real safety issue. If you’re getting your photos on the edge of the bridge, be super careful and keep your balance. The surface can be slippery, so if it’s been raining, steer well clear. Finally, the tea fields and jungle that surround the Nine Arch Bridge are full of creatures and critters, including snakes and leeches. Keep your eyes peeled. For everything you need to know about safety in Sri Lanka, including the historical context, common travel scams, safety on roads, and advice for solo and female travellers, check out our full guide to Sri Lanka safety here RELATED | How to stay safe in Sri Lanka SRI LANKA TRAVEL TIPS | Everything you need to know before travelling to Sri Lanka EXPLORING BEYOND THE NINE ARCH BRIDGE There are a number of excellent Ella attractions that can be visited in conjunction with a visit to the Nine Arch Bridge. LITTLE ADAMS PEAK After a morning visit to the Nine Arch Bridge, we suggest taking the mildly strenuous hike through the stunning Ella countryside to Little Adam’s Peak. Named after its similarly shaped, yet far taller older brother, Adam’s Peak, the Little Adam’s Peak hike takes about two-hours roundtrip from Ella town and starts in the lush tea plantations before slowly snaking its way to the first set of viewpoints. From here, you'll have 360-degree views overlooking the giant Ella Rock and Ella Gap towards Udawalawe National Park, perfect for photos. We'd definitely advise continuing the hike further down the ridge, as the views become more spectacular and less busy. The return route follows the other side of the mountain, overlooking the incredible 98 Acres resort before slowly making its way back to Ella. Stop at the little wooden juice hut on the return journey back to relax and grab a refreshing king coconut. We recommend hiking up during the late afternoon and watching the glorious sunset unfold; and definitely advise against hiking during the middle of the day as there's little shade to hide from the glaring sun - one of our worst-ever travel burns happened right here! THE DETAILS Where | Little Adam’s Peak, Ella Cost | FREE How to get to Little Adams Peak | It’s possible to catch a tuk-tuk to the base of Little Adam’s Peak, before following the sign-posted pathway to the peak. It’s also a very easy walk from Ella town. Walk the Ella - Passara Rd, turning right at Ella Flower Garden resort before following the signs to Little Adam’s Peak. HIKE UP THE FAMOUS ELLA ROCK For a longer walk from Nine Arch Bridge along the train tracks, the summit of Ella rock, with its views over Ella, Little Adam's Peak, and Ella Gap, is one vantage point you don’t want to miss out on. Follow the Ella to Kandy train line past many beautiful waterfalls, bridges, tea plantations, and homes, before starting your ascent towards the Ella Rock summit - hopefully with a King Coconut in hand for some extra energy. We definitely needed it; the hike to the summit under that fierce sun is tough! Once at the summit, we enjoyed the incredible views for at least an hour, munching away on our vegetarian roti and some well-deserved water. The route to the summit can be a little complicated, however, if you follow the clearly marked paths and ignore the (sometimes deliberately misleading) touts, you shouldn't have too many issues (this in-depth post will help you get there). All up, the hike takes around 2 hours round trip, but remember to pack enough water and snacks to power your journey.

In the meantime, here are a few key details to keep in mind: HOW TO GET TO ELLA, SRI LANKA You can get to Ella (Uva Province) via train or bus, although if the option is available, we highly, highly recommend you take the train - after all, there’s a reason this is one of the most popular train rides in the world! BY TRAIN COLOMBO TO ELLA | The direct train from Colombo Fort to Ella encompasses the world-famous Kandy to Ella train ride, however, we’d highly recommend breaking up the journey and spending time in Kandy (read our guide to Kandy ). If you’re keen to get straight to Ella, be prepared for a 10+ hour train ride. KANDY TO ELLA | One of the great train rides in the world, and one of the best things you’ll do in Sri Lanka . Expect the train ride from Kandy to Ella to take between 6-8 hours. We recommend booking 3rd class for the most authentic experience. BY BUS COLOMBO TO ELLA | From Colombo/Pettah bus station, take the bus to Bandarawela (around LKR 200 - 700), where you’ll need to change and jump on a connecting bus to Ella (LKR 50 - 100). Or, for the final part of the journey, hire a tuk-tuk to Ella town (LKR 500). This takes a total of 7-8 hours. KANDY TO ELLA | To be honest, don’t even think about taking a bus on this route - the train ride is too beautiful to miss. THE SOUTH TO ELLA | From Unawatuna, Mirissa, Hiriketiya, etc to Ella, take a local bus to Matara bus station (LKR 50 - 200), then change to the Matara - Bandarawela bus (#31, or 31-1 bus). It’ll stop in Ella via Wellawaya, and will take around 5-6 hours.

Whichever name you know Sri Lanka by, there’s one thing we can all agree on: this bite-sized Utopia has boomed onto the travel scene in a big way over the last couple of years - and it’s here to stay. Sri Lanka is one of our favourite countries, and part of that appeal lies in just how much it has to offer on such a small territory. For a country, roughly the same size as Ireland, this small island nation boasts an endless array of attractions: white beaches and pumping surf , lush tropical jungle and misty mountain towns , ancient World Heritage sites where elephants and leopards still roam, and enchanting train rides through rolling tea plantations. In fact, after two separate trips there, we’re utterly convinced that there’ll never be enough time to discover all of the treasure Sri Lanka has up its sleeve - at least, not without a little help! That’s why we’ve put together our guide for the best places to visit in Sri Lanka, divided into adventure, cultural, natural, and foodie experiences to help you discover this beautiful island for yourself. From rope swings at Dalawella to spotting leopards in Yala , discovering ancient rock fortresses to authentic slices of life in local markets, we’ve got you covered! ADVENTURE EXPERIENCES | THE BEST PLACES TO VISIT IN SRI LANKA #1 JUMP ON SRI LANKA’S SOUTHERN COAST ROPE SWINGS To this day, we're still amazed that a simple rope swing could have single-handedly turned a country into a travel 'hot spot', yet that's exactly what happened here in Sri Lanka. Thanks to a couple of well-known travel Instagrammers, the rope swings on the southern coast went viral on Instagram, and before long every single visitor to the country wanted 'that shot'. Although a little gimmicky, it really is a heap of fun and, considering the location and stunning tropical setting, is definitely one of the best places to visit in Sri Lanka! The best rope swings are located at Dalawella beach and Mihiripenna beach, just south of Unawatuna, although others can be found all the way along the coast. There are also a ton of great things to do in the area, which you can read in our Unawatuna guide . THE DETAILS Where | Dalawella Beach , Unawatuna Cost | Generally LKR 500 for 5+ swings (and, in our opinion, a rare tourist trap that’s worth it!)

After climbing the leg-burning 5,500 stairs to the summit, we waited for dawn to approach surrounded by hundreds of pilgrims from all religions. The nearby hill country slowly came into vision, before the sky turned all shades of pink, orange and finally blue. Pilgrims chanted, bells tolled, and tears were shed. Rising from the famous rolling hills of Sri Lanka's hill country, the summit of Sri Pada (Adam's Peak), is one of the most iconic natural landmarks in the country. It's also home to myth and legend for Buddhist, Islamic, Hindi and Christian faiths; the summit is said to be home to Buddha's footprint, where Adam set foot on Earth after being cast out of heaven, and Shiva's footprint. No matter whether you're religious or not, hiking to the top of Sri Pada, or Adam's Peak, is definitely one of the best things to do in Sri Lanka. THE DETAILS Where | Sri Pada / Adam’s Peak Cost | FREE #3 LEARN TO SURF IN WELIGAMA The whole southern coast of Sri Lanka is a surfer’s paradise; awesome breaks at just about every corner attract sliders from all over the world. For beginner surfers like us (we know, we’re terrible Australians!), it's also a great place to learn, with warm waters, cheap boards and easy waves the perfect combination to catch that first wave. The best place to learn to surf along the coast is Weligama, located around 2.5 hours south of Colombo or 30 minutes from the popular town of Unawatuna . Built for surfers, there are hundreds of surf schools located right on the beach - just turn up, speak to a tout and you’ll be learning your way around a board just a few minutes later. A 1 - 1.5 hour lesson costs around LKR 2,500 per person, and will teach you the basics of surfing including how to stand up, paddling for a wave, surfing etiquette, and safety. Somehow, we both managed to stand within our first five waves, and the thrill was incredible. We're now 100% converted to surfing. If Weligama isn't your jam, you can learn to surf in many places on the south and east coast, including Unawatuna , Hiriketiya , and Arugam Bay. After a surf, go a hang out with the legends at Ceylon Sliders , a boutique hotel-cum-cafe-cum-surf store celebrating surf culture in Sri Lanka. They happen to have some of the best food in Sri Lanka, as well as the coolest staff we've ever met.

Flanked by verdant forests and tea plantations, the Nine Arch Bridge stands proudly across the valley below. Calling it picturesque would be doing it an understatement, particularly on a misty day when the cloud hangs low in the valley and creates a moody, mystical scene. Completed in 1921, Nine Arch Bridge is built entirely out of brick, rock and cement, with no metal used in its construction - an incredible engineering feat back in those days. Spanning 91 meters and a height of 24 feet, the bridge is on the famous Kandy to Bandarawela (via Ella) train line , with trains passing around five times a day depending on the ever-changing Sri Lankan train timetable. There are plenty of epic viewpoints to see the bridge from. The most popular is the actual bridge itself, another is below from the tea plantation (this is private land, so please ask for permission before entering). For us, the best views were from above, either looking from the forests surrounding the bridge or from one of the cafe platforms in the surrounding hills. Watching the train slowly make its way across the bridge is a wonderful sight!

One of the best things to do in Ella is the famous Ella rock hike, which offers spectacular views over Ella, Little Adam's Peak, and the surrounding jungle-clad valley. We started our hike at the famous Ella train station, following the Ella to Kandy train line past many beautiful waterfalls, bridges, tea plantations, and homes, before starting our ascent towards the Ella Rock summit, king coconut in hand for some extra energy. We needed it; the hike to the summit is tough! We sat at the summit for at least an hour, enjoying a vegetarian roti and some well-deserved water while taking in the incredible views. The route to the summit can be a little complicated, however if you follow the clearly marked paths and ignore the touts, you shouldn't have too many issues (this in-depth post will help you get there). All up, the hike takes around 2 hours roundtrip, but remember to pack enough water and snacks to power your journey as the days can get quite hot.

Cascading from high in the Sri Lankan mountains, Diyaluma falls may be a little off the beaten track, but the epic views and natural infinity pools make the trek worth the effort. After a two-hour tuk-tuk ride from Ella to Poonagala, through quintessentially Sri Lankan tea plantations, we set off on foot, hiking downhill through long, dry grass for around 30 minutes before getting our first glimpse of the upper Diyaluma falls. A short walk further and there we were, standing at the lower Diyaluma Falls, above a sheer 220m rush of water to the valley floor below. We watched the sun set over the valley below from the top of the falls, joined by a group of young local guys keen to chat about our travels (and cricket, of course!). We flew our drone, snapped a few incredible photos of the surrounding landscapes, and relaxed before reluctantly commencing our journey back to Ella.

One of the most popular short hikes in the area is to the top of Little Adam's Peak. A golden afternoon we spent watching the world go by from Little Adam's peak was one of the highlights of our time in Sri Lanka on our first trip to the island in 2016. The full hike takes about two hours from Ella town and starts in the lush tea plantations before slowly snaking its way to the first set of viewpoints. From here you'll have 360-degree views overlooking the giant Ella Rock and green valley towards Udawalawe , perfect for photos. We'd definitely advise continuing the hike further down the ridge, as the views become more spectacular and less busy. Here, we sat and relaxed in the grass, eating our lunch while watching storm clouds form in the distance. The return route follows the other side of the mountain, overlooking the incredible 98 Acres resort before slowly making its way back to Ella. Stop on the return journey back to relax and grab a refreshing king coconut or juice from the little wooden hut near the start of the trek!. We recommend hiking up during late afternoon and before watching glorious sunset unfold; and advise against hiking during the middle of the day as there's little shade to hide from the glaring sun (fun fact: our worst sunburns in 3 months of travel through Asia happened from doing this hike at midday!).

The 1268sq km park is home to a rich array of dunes, forests, open plains and lush lagoons, which also attracts a huge diversity of wildlife; 44 mammal species (including elephants) and over 215 bird species, to be exact! Most visit Yala National Park for two reasons: the opportunity to see Leopards and Elephants in the wild. Yala contains one of the largest densities of Leopards in the world, with an estimated 25 leopards roaming Block 1 alone. If you’ve dreamed of spotting these glorious creatures in the wild, a safari in Yala is absolutely your best chance to witness the elusive cats, while an elephant sighting is basically a given. We were fortunate enough to see both during our early morning safari, stumbling across a beautiful elephant family at a watering hole, although our leopard sighting was only through a trusty set of long-range binoculars. As Yala is so popular with locals and tourists alike, the safari routes can get very popular and crowded, especially when a leopard sighting has been reported. We were on safari the first morning that the park was open for the season, and actually got stuck in a 30-minute traffic jam to see a Leopard! To avoid this, we'd suggest visiting during the shoulder season or joining a safari tour group. Note: We booked our tour within minutes of arriving in the nearby town of Tissa, as there are plenty of drivers/guides waiting at the station to book passengers for the next day. Easy peasy!

In fact, during our early morning safari, we spotted well over 15 elephants, including a number of impossibly cute bubs. Sprawling across the southern lowlands, nestled near the towering Horton Plains, Udawalawe is one of the most popular parks in Sri Lanka. Although the park's landscape is fairly monotonous, it provides the best viewing opportunities for elephants and other fauna. It’s also possible to spot buffalo, monkeys, deer, crocodiles and leopards (although the latter is extremely rare). In many ways, we preferred our safari in Udawalawe to Yala National Park, mostly due to the numerous elephant sightings, and the lack of crowds, which overrun Yala in peak season.

Tri Lanka , a five-star, sustainable, luxury retreat nestled into the jungle that surrounds Koggala Lake on Sri Lanka’s southern coast, is truly one of the greatest accommodation experiences we’ve ever had. Not only is the entire hotel absolutely stunning, but everything about Tri is designed to be in and of the nature that surrounds it. From the construction and design that incorporates local materials and the most up-to-date sustainable practices right through to the locally-sourced (and seasonal) gourmet food served in the restaurant, Tri Hotel is turning the image of sustainable travel on its head by marrying conscious travel and blissful luxury together perfectly. It’s also focused on nurturing your body, mind, and soul, which means there are plenty of activities available, including Quantum yoga classes, bicycles tours of the local village, boat trips out to Cinnamon island, a beautiful organic spa and glass-walled library and reading room, and if all that wasn’t enough to keep you satisfied, there that insta-famous infinity pool too. Bliss! This is the ultimate splurge and one of the best places to visit in Sri Lanka, but trust us, it’s worth it (read all about our time at Tri Hotel here ).

Each afternoon at around 5:30pm, locals and tourists alike gather along the Fort walls to watch the sunset over the Indian Ocean. It’s a festive and happy affair; cricket games are played on the grass below, whole families gather to see of the last of the day, and travellers mingle and chat while Mother Nature streaks the sky all kinds of shades of blue, orange, pink and purple. The best point to watch the sunset from is the Triton Bastion, however you can watch the sunset from pretty much any point on the western side of the Fort walls and be guaranteed a great view. Don’t forget to keep a lookout for the cliff jumpers at Flag Rock too; each evening a group of locals defy danger by leaping backwards off the ramparts to the ocean below.

Each day we'd swim, eat, and surf. Each night, we'd make our way down to the beach to watch the sunset (a very typical evening during our month in Sri Lanka), marvelling at the kaleidoscope of colours that lit up the sky. Although there are plenty of things to see and do in Mirissa, one of our favourite places to visit in Sri Lanka was the insta-famous and delightful Coconut Tree Hill . Although it’s been plastered all over social media, it really is a beautiful and unique place to see with your own eyes, with literally hundreds of palms jutting out of this small, burnt orange hill. Located at the eastern end of Mirissa beach , the views over Mirissa are spectacular, and there are plenty of places to just chill and watch the world go by. Although it's gaining in popularity quickly, early mornings are relatively free from crowds, while a clear evening will gift you some pretty epic sunset views from here. For anyone thirsty, there’s a small makeshift bar nearby for a quick sundowner!

Formerly reserved exclusively for Kandyan Royals and with a history dating back to 1371, Peradeniya was turned into botanical gardens in 1821 at the behest of the British. The gardens are now home to over 10,000 trees spread across 60 hectares (the largest garden in the country), showcasing all of Sri Lanka’s fl", "images":

It was a hot day. A very hot day. The type of day you stay inside and avoid the sun at all costs, or laze by the pool and take a dip every 30 minutes to cool down. And yet here we were, in the back of a tuk-tuk, roaring along the chaotic roads towards Polonnaruwa, regretting all our life choices. Those life choices involved a 5 am wake-up to watch the sunrise at Sigiriya , and a day trip to the sacred city of Polonnaruwa, all in the middle of April, Sri Lanka’s warmest and most humid month. We arrived at the entrance to Polonnaruwa notably sweaty, parched, and with a severe case of travel fatigue (you know, the times when you really can’t be bothered seeing another temple, church or ruin, and instead you’d rather be sipping a Negroni by the sea). Like the curtain dropping to begin a theatre production, our fatigue immediately dissipated as we entered the UNESCO World-Heritage-listed . Surrounded by an abundance of green, the vast, impressive ruins of Polonnaruwa lay. Similar to Cambodia’s Angkor Wat , potentially without the grandeur or worldwide fame, Polonnaruwa is one of Sri Lanka’s premier attractions, sitting in the heart of the country’s famed cultural triangle. Once the capital of ancient Sri Lanka , Polonnaruwa was built between the 10th and 12th centuries and quickly became the thriving commercial and religious epicentre of the country. Made up of a series of stunning temples and religious buildings, the site is vast and in parts, stunningly beautiful. We spent hours exploring the ruins, admiring the ornate details, overwhelmingly large religious monuments, and ingenuity from a culture and part of history we knew little about. Despite the heat and travel fatigue, our day spent exploring the vast ruins of Polonnaruwa, almost to ourselves, remains one of our most memorable. For intrepid travellers, the ruins offer a chance to walk between ancient ruins and get up close and personal with some impressive physical structures. Whether you’re in Sri Lanka for a short, beach-filled trip, or are wanting to explore the country a little deeper, we highly recommend a visit to Polonnaruwa. Below is our guide to the sacred city, including all the important information and inspiration, including how to get there, when to visit, what to see within the complex, and a little historical overview. POLONNARUWA ANCIENT RUINS OVERVIEW WHERE | Polonnaruwa, Sri Lanka WHAT TO SEE | The Sacred Quadrangle, Royal Palace of King Parakramabahu, Rankot Vihara, Gal Vihara WHEN TO VISIT | Jan - March, Arrive at 9 am HOW TO GET THERE | Bus from Dambulla/Sigiriya, Tuk-tuk, or train from Colombo HOW TO GET AROUND | Bike, tuk-tuk or walking POLONNARUWA TRAVEL INFORMATION POLONNARUWA HISTORY The second most ancient city in Sri Lanka, Polonnaruwa holds a wealth of incredible history. Polonnaruwa became the second capital of Sri Lanka in 993 A.D. after the destruction of the previous capital, Anuradhapura in 993. At the time, the capital was called \"Jananathapuram\" and was ruled by the Chola dynasty. After serving as the kingdom of the South Indian Chola Dynasty for three centuries, it was recaptured by the Sinhalese King Vijayabahu I in 1070 A.D. After expelling the Cholas, Vijayabahu I became the first king of the Polonnaruwa kingdom and the king of the whole island. To this day, visitors to Polonnaruwa can still marvel at the Cholas' Brahmanic monuments, which attest to their rule. With the defeat of the Cholas came an era that brought great economic prosperity to Polonnaruwa and spawned a period of Sinhalese cultural renaissance. After the great King Vijayabahu I passed away after ruling the kingdom for 40 years, King Parakramabahu I was crowned in Polonnaruwa, and under his rule, the city reached its height of power and glory, becoming Sri Lanka’s version of the Gardens of Babylon. During the rule of King Parakramabahu, a vast irrigation network with reservoirs that resembled natural inland seas were created, leading to extensive rice farming, earning Sri Lanka the nickname \"The Granary of the Orient”. With its heyday waning by the early 13th century, the city was abandoned, and the capital relocated to the western part of the island, where modern-day Colombo now stands. Later, in 1982, Polonnaruwa was declared a UNESCO world heritage site . The ancient city of Polonnaruwa is still one of the most meticulously preserved archaeological sites in Sri Lanka today, bearing witness to the rigour and brilliance of the kingdom's founding monarchs. WHERE IS POLONNARUWA Polonnaruwa is located in the North Central Province of Sri Lanka in an area otherwise known as the cultural triangle, about 220km from the nation's capital, Colombo, and around 50km from the imperious Sigiriya. Rich with historical sites and cultural masterpieces, including Sigiriya , Dambulla and Anuradhapura, this area is home to many of Sri Lanka’s grand former capitals dating back over 1,000 years. It’s also home to vast swathes of national parks, which allows extensive sightseeing with very little effort. For history and nature buffs, it’s basically heaven. WHEN IS THE BEST TIME TO VISIT POLONNARUWA? Sri Lanka’s weather, much like its politics, is a complicated beast punctuated by two separate monsoons, which affect different parts of the island and at different times of the year. With this in mind, if you’re wanting to visit the incredible sights of Polonnaruwa, December to March is the best time to visit. We visited in April, and it was overwhelmingly hot and uncomfortable, which led to a few grumpy moments as we explored the complex (heat + hunger = fights!). We highly recommend arriving in Polonnaruwa as early as possible, mostly to avoid the incessant tropical heat and sun, but also to avoid the crowds that begin to build from 10 am. We suggest arriving between 8 am - 9 am. READ | Learn more about when to travel to Sri Lanka in our Sri Lanka travel guide POLONNARUWA ENTRANCE FEE The entrance fee for Polonnaruwa is quite pricey, set at $25.00 USD per person for foreign visitors (a 50% discount applies for SAARC countries). For some, this might be prohibitive (backpackers, for instance!), however, the fee does include entry to the vast museum complex (more on that below) and the UNESCO World Heritage-listed ruins, so we feel it’s 100% worth it. Alternatively, if you’d prefer a guided tour of the complex by bike, this tour is perfect for you - not only does it include the entrance fee, you’ll get an English-speaking guide to take you through the extensive history of the complex (book in advance here ). There’s also a tuk-tuk tour if you’d prefer to save your legs for hiking Sigiriya and Pidurangala . TIP | Arrive early to avoid crowds and the heat HOW TO GET AROUND POLONNARUWA As Polonnaruwa is spread out over a large area, there is some travel time required to reach the various site within the ancient city. These are the best way to explore the historic ruins: RENT A BIKE Probably the best (and most cost-effective and efficient) way to explore the ancient city of Polonnaruwa is to rent a bike. While pedalling through the archaeological site, you can take in more sights while navigating between the attractions at your own pace. This, in the Sri Lankan heat, is absolutely essential (we recommend taking many breaks, preferably ice cream breaks). The entire tour takes about 4 to 5 hours at a leisurely pace. Bikes can be rented at the entrance to the complex near the museum, or in town near the bus stop Cost | 400 LKR, ($2.25) per bike WALKING Walking is an option if you have a full day free and an abundance of stamina (or are sadistic). Even though Polonnaruwa's archaeological site is smaller than that of nearby Anuradhapura, it can still be intimidating. We recommend walking if you’re fairly fit, and can stand to be on your feet and explore for at least 8 hours straight. Thankfully there are numerous shady spots to rest your weary bones should you need to - just pack a LOT of water. HIRE A TUK-TUK GUIDE As much as we hate to admit it, we hired a tuk-tuk to drive us from Dambulla to Polonnaruwa, and he then drove us throughout the ancient complex - although the caveat is that it was about 35 degrees, and 100% humidity, however, it did end up saving us time and effort in the scorching heat. In our opinion, we’d suggest riding through the complex as it will allow you to explore at your own pace, and take in more of the incredible surroundings. But, tuk-tuks can be a convenient mode of transportation if you'd rather not engage in any sort of physical activity, particularly in the scorching heat. Cost | 1,200 LKR ($6.5) per tuk-tuk Book | Book this highly rated tuk-tuk tour HOW TO GET TO POLONNARUWA Polonnaruwa, like most of Sri Lanka , is easy to get to, mostly due to the size of the Island and the abundance of transport options, which include buses, trains, and tuk-tuks. One thing to keep in mind, though, is that Kaduruwela is considered Polonnaruwa new town, so any public transport will generally arrive there. Our visit to Polonnaruwa was via tuk-tuk from Dambulla, where we saw both Sigiriya and Polonnaruwa in the same day. It was hectic, starting at 5 am, but well worth it to see two incredible ancient sites in one day. If you’re time-poor, this is something we’d advise doing. You can organise a tuk-tuk just about anywhere in town, including at your hotel. Below are the easiest, and most cost-effective ways of getting to Polonnaruwa from major towns and attractions in the area: FROM SIGIRIYA TO POLONNARUWA Bus | Sigirya - Inamaluwa - Polonnaruwa - Kaduruwela | After a short tuk-tuk journey from Sigiriya to Inamaluwa jump on the bus to Kaduruwela. Cost | Tuk-tuk from Sigiriya to Inamaluwa 500 LKR, ($2.8) | Bus #48.16 from Inamaluwa to Polonnaruwa 200 LKR, ($1) per person Travel time | 1.5 hours Tuk Tuk | Sigiriya to Polonnaruwa Cost | 5,000 LKR / $30 USD FROM DAMBULLA TO POLONNARUWA Bus | Dambulla - Polonnaruwa - Kaduruwela | Take a direct bus that heads for Kaduruwela from the Dambulla Main bus stop. The bus leaves every 20-30 minutes starting from 7 am. Cost | Bus #48.16 from Dambulla to Kaduruwela - 220 LKR, ($1) per person Travel time | 1.5 to 2 hours Tuk Tuk | Dambulla to Polonnaruwa Cost | 5,000 LKR / $30 USD FROM COLOMBO TO POLONNARUWA We probably wouldn’t recommend this journey in one day - it’s far better to break up the journey in either Kandy, Dambulla or Sigiriya. Train | Colombo Fort - Polonnaruwa / Batticaloa Special Cost | Tickets start at 1,200 LKR per person Travel time | 5+ hours - Search for train departure times here WHAT TO SEE IN POLONNARUWA Polonnaruwa is filled with architectural and archaeological treasures, encompassing an eclectic range of structures, including rock-cut caves, monasteries, and dagobas, as well as ancient warrior gates, palaces, and other stupas. Whether you are an enthusiastic history buff or not, the sites themselves, as well as their magnificence, will leave a lasting impression on you, and rightly so – they are some of the finest structures to be found in all of Sri Lanka . This medieval city will captivate you with its incredible structures and landscapes, and it will traverse your way through its fascinating history while allowing you to take in all of its natural beauty and historic significance. The following are absolute must-see places to visit in Polonnaruwa that are living testimonies to Sri Lankan history and something that should not be missed at all costs if you ever find yourself in this region. ARCHAELOGICAL MUSEUM OF POLONNARUWA The Archeological Museum of Polonnaruwa is the starting point for your ancient city explorations. You'll find this one-storeyed building once you enter the archaeological site of Polonnaruwa, and despite its small size, it’s a treasure trove of mesmerising ancient artefacts and exhibits. A visit to the museum will allow you to gain a detailed insight and understanding of the sacred city. The museum's layout reflects that of the ancient city, with separate wings devoted to the citadel, the monastery area, the outer city, and the Hindu monuments. Once you visit the section with the artefacts of the ancient surgical instruments, you'll be amazed by how closely they resemble modern surgical instruments. THE ROYAL PALACE OF KING PARAKRAMABAHU The first group of ruins that you’ll come across after leaving the museum will be the ruins of the majestic Royal Palace of King Parakramabahu I. There were once approximately one thousand chambers spread across seven stories in this structure, however a deliberate fire by invaders ruined the structure, so little is still standing today. The Palace was called the \"Vijayantha Prasada,\" and it was believed to be one of the tallest buildings of that era. You can get an idea of the structure's scale by looking at the surviving portions of the massive walls that are thicker than one meter, as well as the foundation walls and parts of the stairway. THE AUDIENCE HALL When exploring the ruins of the Palace, you'll discover a well-preserved structure with three layers of solid rock. The bottom layer is carved beautifully with elephants in different postures. The second layer consists of figures of lions, and the top layer has carvings of \"Wamana.\" That structure is the Audience Hall or the Royal Court of the Palace, and you can climb up the stone stairs to get to the top and wander around the structure's many stone pillars or even get a picture snapped in the middle of the two stone-carved lions at the top. ROYAL BATHING POOL Located right next to the Audience Hall lies the Royal Bathing Pool, nicknamed the \"Kumara Pokuna.\" It's a wider, open space with spouts shaped like crocodile mouths that were once used to bring clean water into the pool. Unfortunately, it’s no longer in use, however, it's evident that it was once a magnificent place to take a dip. THE SACRED QUADRANGLE (DALADA MALUVA) The Dalada Maluwa is one of the best places to visit in Polonnaruwa, and it's where you'll find the imperious Sacred Quadrangle, as well as some other ancient Buddhist ruins. The Sacred Quadrangle is home to over ten magnificent structures, including the Hetadage, Atadage, Vatadage, Image of Boddhisattwa, Sathmahal Prasadaya, and Thuparama. As this site offers multiple places to visit in Polonnaruwa in close vicinity, you should definitely take your time exploring the area. THE POLONNARUWA VATADAGE One of the most famous (and photographed) monuments in Polonnaruwa, Vatadage is truly a sight to behold. This two-tiered relic house has an unusual design that is built with part brick and part stone. The Vatadage is meant to safeguard a dagoba at its centre, and there are four intricate Buddha statues, all facing different entrances to the dagoba. You can marvel at the intricate carvings of this structure, which is said to have housed the \"Scared Tooth Relic of Buddha” before its move to the Temple of the Scared Tooth in Kandy. THE HATADAGE Hatadage is another of the incredible places to visit in Polonnaruwa Quadrangle. This ancient shrine was built by King Nissanka Malla, and there are remnants of the Hatadage's brick and stone walls, but the wooden framework has long since decayed. Originally, this building seemed to have two stories, but the top floor has since been destroyed. Inside the temple, there's a room with three granite Buddha sculptures. THE ATADAGE The final attraction you must see within the Sacred Quadrangle complex is the Atadage, which was built by King Vijayanahu I and is considered the oldest building found in the Sacred Quadrangle.. There's a granite staircase to get to the second floor of the temple, and initially, there were three Buddha statues, although there's only one left. TIP | Remember to remove your shoes when visiting the temples PABALU VEHERA STUPA Pabalu Vehera Stupa is easy to spot due to its unusual architecture and artistic structure. Queen Rupawathi, one of King Parakramabahu's wives, is credited with constructing this historic monastery. It has a peculiar shape, and it has been ravaged by invaders and treasure hunters over the centuries. The Pabalu Vehera Stupa is made of brownish bricks that stand in striking contrast to the lush greenery of the jungle in which it is set. RANKOT VIHARA No visit to Polonnaruwa would be completed without adding a stop at the Rankot Vihara, which is the largest dagoba in Polonnaruwa and the fourth largest dagoba in Sri Lanka. Built during the reign of King Nissanka Malla, this dagoba is undeniably one of the best places to visit in Polonnaruwa. The monastery is made entirely out of brick and is extremely well-preserved. This huge structure is in excellent condition when compared to others in the area. THE IMPRESSIVE LANKATILAKA TEMPLE Probably our favourite temple in the entire complex, this magnificent structure, commissioned by King Parakramabahu, is a lasting reminder of the once-great Polonnaruwa. Its splendour in the 12th century made it one of the most important Buddhist temples in Asia. Bricks were used to construct its walls, which reached an impressive height of 17 meters and had a thickness of a whopping four meters. Inside, there’s an imposing standing Buddha that was once 13 meters tall (including its base), however only the torso remains today. THE BUDDHA FIGURES OF GAL VIHARA Prepared to be blown away when you finally stumble on the buddha figures of Gal Vihara, one of the most well-known rock-cut Buddha statues in Sri Lanka . Also known as the Rock Monastery, this partially man-made cavern is made up of three enormous rock-cut images and one smaller statue, all of which are enchanting in their own right. The Buddha statues at Gal Vihara, each of which has a unique appearance, are without a doubt the most flawless examples of Buddha statues hewn out of solid granite that can be found in Sri Lanka. You won't be disappointed when you come across these priceless artefacts, which are distinctive and very unlike the common carvings found in other areas of the island. POTHGUL VIHARA COMPLEX The final thing we suggest visiting in the sacred city of Polonnaruwa is Pothgul Vehera, a Buddhist library where sacred texts were housed and studied. The complex has a layout unlike any other monastery in the country, making it one of the illustrious places to visit in Polonnaruwa. The site's most notable structure is a shrine with a circular design that was constructed on a square terrace in the middle of the grounds. THINGS TO KNOW BEFORE VISITING THE POLONNARUWA TEMPLES Before visiting the Polonnaruwa ruins, there are a few essential things you need to know: Take a tour | We highly recommend hiring a guide, or joining a pre-booked tour (we recommend this cycling tour or this tuk-tuk tour) of the sacred city. Its sheer size and scale is overwhelming and a guide is able to really help you understand the former grandeur of the complex. They’re not overly expensive, and well worth it Don’t take photos with your back towards Buddha | A common and sacrilegious act amongst foreigners throughout Asia, taking a photo with your back towards Buddha is highly offensive. So just be super careful when taking photos, and remember to respect every religion as you would your own (even atheists!) Take your shoes off before entering scared spaces | In an effort to respect the Buddhist culture, and preserve the important relics, take your shoes and hats off before entering the sacred spaces.

From the bustling markets of Colombo to the mist-covered mountains of Ella and the tranquil beaches of Hiriketiya, this journey through Sri Lanka will ignite your senses and leave you yearning for more. Sri Lanka is one of the world’s great destinations. A place where, in just seven short days, you could go from bustling cities to elephant-covered plains, and over misty mountains to alluring beachside havens. While we often suggest travellers extend their time on the teardrop isle to two weeks or more, we do also regularly receive requests for abbreviated itineraries. The beauty of Sri Lanka is that for those with tighter leave constraints, there’s a whole lot of variety packed into a relatively small square mileage which offers a unique opportunity to see a whole lot in an efficiently short amount of time. With this 7-day Sri Lanka itinerary, you’ll take in some of Sri Lanka’s most famous sites, from the sticky, bustling streets of Colombo to Kandy , the City of Kings and undisputed historical and cultural capital. Then, the rolling hills of Ella and the highlands (best arrived at from the breezy open footboards of the famous Kandy to Ella train , of course!) before a well-earned flop-and-drop ending ending to your trip on the south coast. In this itinerary, we’ve shared the places we think are essential to visit, that showcase Sri Lanka at its very best. We’ve included where to stay, how to get around, some food highlights, and other important travel tips for Sri Lanka. This is the very best of Sri Lanka, in 7 days. LOVE OUR PHOTOS? Edit like us with our Tropical Dreams Preset Packs , and Tropical Bliss mobile video filters, inspired by the tropical beauty and colour of this beautiful country 7-DAY SRI LANKA ITINERARY SNAPSHOT DAY #1 | Explore Colombo DAY #2 | Visit the cultural capital of Kandy DAY #3 | See historic Dambulla & Sigiriya DAY #4 | Kandy to Ella Train, explore Ella DAY #5 | Outdoor fun in Ella DAY #6 | Beach days in Hiriketiya DAY #7 | Colonial history in Galle Fort 7-DAY ITINERARY | SEE THE BEST OF SRI LANKA DAY 1 | EXPLORE COLOMBO The first point of call on your 7-day Sri Lanka itinerary is the capital, Colombo , where the country’s international airport is located (well, it’s actually located just outside of Colombo in Negombo, an hour away). Colombo isn’t our favourite place in the world; A large, sprawling port city that’s lacking in attractions, charm, or beauty, it’s quite easy to arrive in Sri Lanka and head straight to Galle Fort, the cultural hinterland, or emerald southern coast. Yet, while Colombo may be hard to love, spend enough time here and you’ll discover it’s actually an enjoyable city with plenty of atmosphere and character, so jump in a tuk-tuk and experience kamikaze style driving while exploring the city’s treasures. We recommend starting the day at the National Museum, which is a great place to get an understanding of Sri Lanka’s rich and diverse history, from ancient kingdoms to colonial times. Then, head to the colourful and chaotic Pettah Markets, the best place to get initiated with the hustle and bustle of local life in the city. Selling everything from fresh produce to clothing, the chaos is intoxicating if not a little draining. Make sure you eat from one of the street food vendors! Also located in Pettah is the ‘must-see’ Red Mosque (Jami Ul-Alfar Masjid). Built in 1908, the mosque’s tall minarets and domes can be seen from quite a distance and its mesmerising colour patterns and architecture are enough to take your breath away. It's possible for both men and women to enter, but you need to cover your arms, legs and hair. The city's cultural melting pot is reflected in its excellent cuisine, with a diverse range of street food vendors, upscale restaurants serving everything from spicy curries to fresh seafood, and the ubiquitous street food, kottu. We suggest making your way to Ministry of Crab for lunch and enjoying one of Sri Lanka’s prime restaurant experiences. Explore the colonial relics in the historic Fort area, where the colonial history of the city is evident in its architecture, with grand old buildings sitting side-by-side with modern skyscrapers. In the late afternoon, do as the locals do, and head to Galle Face Green for sunset. This is an ocean-side urban park, stretching along the coast in the heart of Colombo. Pack with vendors selling everything from cooked crabs to sliced mango and chilli (a popular Sri Lankan street food!), it’s a great place to grab an afternoon ice cream and watch the locals indulge in their favourite pastimes. Oh, and one more food tip - if/when you hear the noise and rhythm of metal on metal, stop! It means one thing: Sri Lanka’s famous street food, kottu roti. A delicious mash-up of roti, onions, leek, cabbage, eggs and sometimes chicken, mutton, beef, or our fave, cheese, Kottu roti is basically the best food ever. Our fave is Uwa Hotel (hotel means restaurant in Sri Lanka). COLOMBO | THE DETAILS Where to stay in Colombo | Cinnamon Grand Hotel is a great luxury option, or the more affordable Vibe Hostel How to get around Colombo | Colombo isn’t easy to get around, however, trusty tuk-tuks are your best bet. Always use the ‘Pick Me’ app to book a tuk-tuk, or hire a tuk-tuk off the street (but always ask for the driver to put the meter on - this is a common travel mistake) PLAN | Plan your time in Colombo with our city guide DAY 2 | EXPLORE THE CULTURAL CAPITAL OF KANDY Take an early private transfer from Colombo to the City of Kings, Kandy , Sri Lanka’s second city and the island’s undisputed historical and cultural capital. The best-known of these sites is the Temple of the Tooth relic; Buddhism’s most important religious shrine, and said to be the location of a piece of Buddha’s tooth. Spend a few hours here to fully appreciate the temple and the surrounding Royal Palace. After lunch, make a visit to The Royal Botanic Gardens of Peradeniya, the largest and most extensive in Sri Lanka, which are amongst the best in the world, home to the impressive and insta-worthy avenue of royal palms. When you’re done sightseeing, there are also a number of expansive lawns in which to relax and escape the Sri Lankan heat. Spend the rest of the day walking Kandy’s stunning city lake, and meandering through the streets, laneways and market areas of the old town, which during the afternoon golden hour, take on a whole new level of beauty. To top off your Kandy experience, you must visit an evening session of the Kandy Cultural Dance Show . Showcasing the traditional dances of the former Kandy Kingdom, the artistic show is filled with incredible costumes, dances, acrobatics and fire walking - a seriously stimulating experience from start to finish, and one you won’t be able to keep your eyes off. The show starts at 5:30 pm daily and is housed close to Kandy Lake at the Kandy Lake Club. We highly recommend booking tickets in advance, which you can do here . KANDY | THE DETAILS Where to stay in Kandy | We stayed at Kandy City View Hotel , and also recommend Helga’s Folly , and OZO Kandy How to get around Kandy | Kandy is a very walkable city, however, use Pick Me or Uber for attractions further away. Beware of Kandy’s tuk-tuk mafia who are notorious for overcharging unsuspecting tourists PLAN | The best things to do in Kandy DAY 3 | DISCOVER THE WONDERS OF SIGIRIYA & DAMBULLA CAVE TEMPLE Located north of Kandy is the cultural heartland of Sri Lanka, an area filled with incredible UNESCO World Heritage sites, National Parks and endless beauty. Start your day early with a transfer from Kandy to Sigiriya, an ancient palace and fortress built in 480AD atop a unique rock island that rises 200m above the jungle below. Starting in the gardens, the hike to the summit of Sigiriya is demanding; it is 1200 steps after all. You’ll then pass through ancient frescoes, the 1600-year-old Mirror Wall, and the famous lion paws. From here, it’s more stairs up to the top. Although arduous and a little sweaty (even at 8 am we were drenched!), the hike is absolutely worth it - the view from the top is awe-inspiring; weathered stone ruins overlook the dense jungle, surrounding plains, and the incredible fortress grounds below. Often referred to as the eighth wonder of the world, Sigiriya is an astounding site to witness, and one of the most impressive attractions Sri Lanka has to offer - read our guide to Sigiriya to find out more. Next, visit nearby Dambulla and the famous royal rock temple complex of Dambulla. This UNESCO World Heritage site sits proudly atop a 160m rock and contains five separate caves with over 150 Buddhist statues and paintings, some dating back over 2,000 years. These are related to Gautama Buddha and his life, with murals covering over 2,100 square metres of cave walls, including depictions of the temptation by the demon Mara, and Buddha's first sermon. The views from atop the rock are incredible, overlooking the surrounding valley, with Sigiriya in the distance; just watch out for the monkeys as they can be rather vicious! To make life easier on this short week-long itinerary, we suggest staying another night in Kandy. THE DETAILS Where | Sigiriya, Sri Lanka , Dambulla cave temple complex , Dambulla Where to stay | Book Back of Beyond Pidurangala here , or search for other accommodation in Sigiriya here Cost | Sigiriya entry: LKR 4,500. Dambulla entry: LKR 1,500 PLAN | How to visit Sigiriya DAY 4 & 5 | KANDY TO ELLA TRAIN, AND EXPLORE ELLA Get up early for one of the best experiences in Sri Lanka and the highlight of your 7-day Sri Lanka itinerary - catching the train from Kandy to Ella. Winding through misty forests, verdant tea plantations; over gushing waterfalls and streams, and past colourful towns and excitable locals, the train ride from Kandy to Ella is, in our opinion, the most picturesque train ride in the world. Grab a window seat (on the left) for the seven-hour ride and watch the lush countryside roll by. Upon arrival at Ella, prepare to be blown away. Tucked away in the misty Sri Lankan high country, amongst idyllic green hills and flowing waterfalls, Ella is the centre of all things outdoors, and there’s so much to see and do in Ella that you could spend a month here, however with one full day, you will be able to see the main sites. Upon arrival, take an afternoon hike to Ella Rock, one of Ella’s most popular attractions. The hike is fairly strenuous, however, with the spectacular views over Ella, Little Adam's Peak, and Ella Gap, it’s an epic place to witness. Treat yourself to a well-earned fresh coconut at the summit. In the evening, visit the iconic Cafe Chill in the centre of town for good food and good vibes. Alternatively, treat yourself to some of the best Sri Lankan rice & curry and Matey Hut. On day #5, get up early and head to the mystical Nine Arch Bridge , where you’ll have the place to yourself (minus a few instagrammers like us!). The Nine Arch Bridge, a must-see in Ella, stands proudly across the valley below, flanked by verdant forests and tea plantations. On misty days, low cloud hangs in the valley, giving the whole area a moody, mystical feel. It’s just a bridge, but a bloody beautiful one at that. If you’re keen to get ’that’ shot, of the train going over the bridge, be there around the following times 9:30, 11:30, 15:30, 16:30, and 17:30 (train times are notoriously unreliable in Sri Lanka, so it may be a little late!). After a quick breakfast in town, jump aboard a tuk-tuk tour to visit the famous Lipton Seat, as well as the Lipton tea factory, where you can learn all about Sri Lanka’s most famous (and delicious) export. Don’t forget to sample some tea while overlooking the gorgeous views. Afternoons are best spent hiking Little Adam’s Peak. The easy trek takes about two-hours roundtrip from Ella town and starts in the lush tea plantations before slowly snaking its way to the first set of viewpoints. From here, you'll have 360-degree views overlooking the giant Ella Rock and Ella Gap towards Udawalawe National Park , perfect for photos. Hike up late afternoon and watch the glorious sunset unfold before you. On the way down, stop by the hip Ravenna Pool Club for a swim, cocktail and good vibes. If you have time, finish your time in Ella by doing a traditional Sri Lankan cooking class at Lanka's. Run by Lanka himself out of a purpose-built kitchen area at his family home, and using traditional clay pots over a fire; this is about as authentic a cooking experience as you can get in Sri Lanka . You’ll learn how to cook an assortment of curries, including potato, okra, beetroot, pumpkin, and jackfruit curries in no time at all - and they were pretty amazing if we do say so ourselves! ELLA | THE DETAILS Where to stay in Ella | We’ve written a comprehensive guide to where to stay in Ella featuring all the best hotels, hostels, and guesthouses to stay in for all budgets. How to get from Ella to Kandy | The Ella to Kandy train (2nd class: LKR 310, 3rd class: LKR 175) - Read our Kandy to Ella train guide for all the details (including how to book tickets on 12go.asia) READ | All the best things to do in Ella , A comprehensive guide to the Nine Arch Bridge , A guide to Diyaluma Waterfall , Where to stay in Ella DAY 6 | EMBRACE THE SOUTHERN COAST Leaving the misty mountains behind, it’s time to embrace Sri Lanka’s famed southern coast. There are many amazing seaside candidates, including Unwatuna, Mirissa and Hikkaduwa, however, we suggest spending time in the hipster enclave of Hiriketiya . What was once a sleepy hidden gem on Sri Lanka’s south coast, Hiriketiya is fast becoming the ‘it’ place for digital nomads and their acai bowls, bronzed surfers riding waves all day long, and salty-haired wanderers chilling into a new level of zen. We suspect it feels a little like Bali did 30 years ago, and we’re secretly hoping it stays this way. Start your days at Bahia, which serves exceptional coffee, delicious breakfast tacos, and rosti eggs benedict which are to die for. You’ll be in foodie heaven here (and enjoy a welcome respite from rice and curry!). For the rest of the day, take your pick of beachside relaxation, surfing or yoga. Or all. Surfers can hire boards from the water’s edge for around LKR 250 ($1.50!), which is an absolute bargain. Be warned though - the waves get very busy from mid-morning to sunset, so we'd suggest surfing just after sunrise. Also, please remember to use surfing etiquette and respect the locals and their waves. For the ultimate zen, join a yoga session (or two) set amongst the jungles of Hiriketiya at Salt House. In the late afternoon, head to Mond for cocktails and good vibes. And for dinner, book Smoke & Bitters, one of Asia’s top #50 bars, serving food and cocktails with locally sourced ingredients (bitters, syrups, liqueurs and spirit infusions are made in-house!). Try the signature Mai Chai, which uses chai rum, chai tea, orgeat, chai syrup and triple sec, and wash it down with the kurumba calamari, made from tempura coconut flesh and topped with salsa. Honestly, this is the best restaurant and bar in Sri Lanka, so enjoy. THE DETAILS Where | Hiriketiya Beach Where to stay in Hiriketiya | Jasper House is peak Sri Lanka -12 airy rooms feature beautiful rooms with local furniture, antique decor, and a few steps to the surf. Read more | Our ultimate guide to Hiriketiya DAY 7 | UNMISSABLE GALLE FORT Alluring, exotic, and totally loveable, Galle Fort is one of the unmissable points of interest on your Sri Lankan itinerary (you can learn all about Galle Fort with our guide ). Narrow, bustling laneways and crumbling colonial relics, an ever-present scent of exotic spices and the incredible tropical setting; there’s just something about this UNESCO World Heritage site that charms and captivates. By morning, explore the Galle Fort walls and ramparts, starting at the historic Clock Tower, before moving onto the Main Gate. There’s a heap of historic buildings to see within the Fort, including the Dutch Reform Church and the restored Old Dutch Hospital. Finish at the famous Galle Fort Lighthouse. Alternatively, head outside the Galle Fort to the local fruit, spice and flower markets to embrace some authentic Sri Lankan culture. During the day, escape the incessant heat and shop in some of the local boutiques, art galleries, and spice and gem stores, or pick yourself up a retro Ceylon poster from Stick No Bills (our favourite shop in Galle Fort). Each afternoon, join the locals and tourists alike and head to the fort walls to watch the sunset over the Indian Ocean (Trition Bastion or Galle Lighthouse are your best bet). We’ve now visited Galle twice on two separate trips, and watching a sunset from the Fort walls remains one of our favourite things to do in Galle. By night, there is a myriad of great restaurants to choose from, from local ‘rice and curry’ haunts to upmarket one-dining. We loved A Minute by Tuk Tuk at the Old Dutch Hospital, where they served delicious contemporary Sri Lankan food. Try 'Batu Moju', an eggplant moju with roti and curry dips, washed down with the local brew, Lion Beer. While the Fort is rapidly gentrifying, it really is one of the best places to visit in Sri Lanka, and a must on any Sri Lanka itinerary.

The Fort Printers is our top recommendation, though Read more | Our comprehensive Galle Fort guide , Where to stay in Galle Fort ALTERNATIVE STOPS | SRI LANKA ITINERARY YALA NATIONAL PARK The impressive Yala National Park straddles the southeastern coastline of Sri Lanka and is a must-see on any Sri Lanka itinerary. The 1268sq km park is home to a rich array of dunes, forest, open plains and lush lagoons, which also attracts a huge diversity of wildlife; 44 mammal species (including elephants) and over 215 bird species, to be exact, and leopards, lots of leopards. Book a morning safari (pick up at 5:30 am, park opens at 6:30 am) for the best chance to spot the rare and incredible animals of Sri Lanka. Although you’re not guaranteed to see a leopard, the chances here in Yala are much higher than elsewhere, so keep your eyes peeled. It’s worth noting that the safari routes can get very popular and crowded, especially during high season. To avoid this, we'd suggest visiting during shoulder season or joining a safari tour group. You can book a safari through your accommodation, or when you arrive in Kirinda. There are a number of Jeeps that roam the streets looking for tourists, so enquire with one of these and negotiate a price you’re comfortable with. We negotiated LKR 5,000 for the jeep hire, guide and morning safari, however, this price does not include the park entry fees, which are LKR 3,500 per person.

In fact, during our early morning safari, we spotted well over 15 elephants including a number of impossibly cute bubs. Sprawling across the southern lowlands, nestled near the towering Horton Plains, Udawalawe is one of the most popular parks in Sri Lanka. Although the park's landscape is fairly monotonous, it provides the best viewing opportunities for elephants and other fauna. It’s also possible to spot buffalo, monkeys, deer, crocodiles and leopards (although the latter is extremely rare). In many ways, we preferred our safari in Udawalawe t", "images":

From the historic Fort area to the bustling markets of Pettah, and the city’s stunning temples, our guide covers the top attractions and hidden gems of this vibrant city. Colombo is hard to love. A large, sprawling port city that’s lacking in attractions, charm, or beauty, it’s quite easy to arrive in Sri Lanka and head straight to Galle Fort , the cultural hinterland, or the emerald southern coast. Yet, while Colombo may be hard to love, spend enough time here and you’ll discover it’s actually an enjoyable city with plenty of atmosphere and character. The city is a heady mix of architectural and cultural influences, with historic temples, bustling bazaars, heritage relics and sprawling parks making up the majority of the must-visit attractions. In the historic Fort area, luxury high-rise hotels rub shoulders with gritty backstreets and traditional markets, reflecting the city's contrasts. The colonial history of the city is evident in its architecture, with grand old buildings sitting side-by-side with modern skyscrapers. The city's cultural melting pot is reflected in its excellent cuisine, with a diverse range of street food vendors, upscale restaurants serving everything from spicy curries to fresh seafood, and the ubiquitous street food, kottu. In this guide, we share the best things to do in Colombo, including hidden secrets we’ve found during our five visits to the city. We also share where to stay and eat, and essential travel information to help you get the best out of the city. This is our guide to Colombo, a city hard to love, but loveable nonetheless.

In an effort to rectify this, the Government set about creating a ‘must-see’ attraction, similar to Sydney’s famous Opera House, or Dubai’s Burj Khalifa. The result is the Lotus Tower, the tallest self-supported structure in South Asia and the tallest skyscraper in the country. The colourful, glistening tower is punctuated by a large, lotus-like viewing deck and restaurant. At sunset, as the sun slowly and gracefully descends into the Indian Ocean, casting radiant hues upon the cityscape, the Lotus Tower viewing deck provides a coveted front-row seat to nature's captivating evening show. From here, the city reaches as far as the eye can see. Below, overflowing trains slowly wind their way to Colombo Fort. In the distance, the bustling markets of Pettah resemble a beehive. All along the coast, locals frolic in the warm waters to usher in the evening. In the green outskirts, storms brew and fill the skies with menacing clouds. It’s a mesmerising place to watch the sunset, and worth the entrance fee alone. Beyond that though, the Lotus Tower falls a little flat. There are no real other attractions located within the building, and it feels a little dystopian in parts - with the one caveat being the tower had only recently reopened during our visit. There are big plans for the tower, but for now, beyond the views, the tower is underwhelming. As a result, we recommend visiting just before sunset and letting nature be the star of the show. THE DETAILS Where | Lotus Tower, Colombo Entry Fee | $20 USD for foreigners - to reserve your tickets Email: info@colombolotustower.lk , or purchase on the day Opening Hours | 9.00 am to 9.00 pm during the week, and 9.00 am to 10.00 pm on weekends EMBRACE THE BUSTLING MARKETS OF PETTAH Every time we visit Colombo, we invariably make a beeline for the bustling streets of Pettah to fully immerse ourselves back in the city, and Sri Lanka. The heart and soul of Colombo, the labyrinthine paths of Pettah's markets are a kaleidoscope of colours, sounds, and scents, and provide a deep cultural experience not found in the developed world of sanitised supermarkets and cookie-cutter markets. In short, a visit here is an essential thing to do in Colombo. Tucked in between the port and Colombo Fort station, Pettah has been a hub of trade and commerce since the days of British colonial rule, and home to the city’s large Muslim community. While things have changed since then - for a start, the beautiful colonial architecture of yesteryear is sadly no longer, the markets still showcase Colombo’s rich cultural tapestry. The set of narrow alleyways that make up Pettah feature almost every product known to man - textiles, spices, fresh fruit, jewellery & trinkets, and gems, sold by stony-faced merchants with booming voices. Tuk-tuks and wheelbarrow-pushing porters weave in and out of crowds, and the everpresent smell of cinnamon hangs in the air, briefly interrupted by the smell of crispy samosas, sweet jaggery and fragrant teas (yes, you should stop for a samosa and tea!). There are a number of parts we recommend checking out, including the textile street, which features fabric stalls showcasing intricate silk saris, vibrant batik prints, and ornately embroidered fabrics. Sea Street is home to a treasure trove of gold jewellery and trinkets. Delicate silver necklaces adorned with turquoise stones, intricately designed bangles, and colourful beaded bracelets sparkle under the flickering lanterns, showcasing the expert craftsmanship and tradition of the island. Cultural sights are now few and far between (modernisation hasn’t been kind to Colombo), but there are three important attractions you absolutely must see in the area. Firstly, Jami Ul-Alfar Masjid (Red Mosque), with its distinctive red and white minarets and domes, is one of the most beautiful buildings in Colombo (more on that below). Next up is the historic Khan Clock Tower, built by two brothers from Bombay, and completed around 1923. And finally, the Dutch Museum, which gives an insight into Dutch Colonial rule, and showcases historical artifacts from the period. The market might feel a little overwhelming at first, but we can assure you it’s safe and friendly - expect storeholders to strike up a conversation, or invite you in to try a local tea; however, take the usual safety precautions, especially with your valuable. To fully enjoy the markets, we suggest visiting in the afternoon, when the golden light caresses the streets, and the temperatures are somewhat cooler. THE DETAILS Where | Pettah Markets, Colombo Fort When to visit | From 4 pm WALK THROUGH THE CRUMBLING COLONIAL STREETS Colonialism was an abhorrent period in human history. But the architecture left behind from this period, though borne of troubled history, is in our opinion, among the most visually beautiful there is. And while Colombo may have rivalled Singapore in the days past, a lot of the grand buildings from this period are sadly torn down or in a state of disrepair. Still, if you’re a fan of colonial architecture, we suggest an afternoon of strolling the historic districts in search of heritage relics. The epicentre of old Colombo is Fort, home to many of the city’s most historic buildings, including the stunning red & white Cargills building, Old Parliament Building, and the magnificent clock tower that harks back to the British era. Chatham Street in particular is gorgeous, featuring a mix of Dutch, British and Islamic architecture. Located close by is the popular Dutch Hospital Precinct, a colonial-era complex now transformed into a vibrant dining and shopping destination, home to one of Colombo’s best restaurants, Ministry of Crab. Slave Island may have a horrific history; it’s named after the slaves brought by the Dutch to Colombo, however, amongst its modern developments, you'll discover some beautiful, low-rise buildings, and the Slave Island Railway Station, a crumbling architectural gem from the British colonial period. And finally, the green streets of Cinnamon Gardens are home to stately former mansions that once housed the city's elite, now serving as embassies, government offices, and cultural institutions. Don't miss the National Museum of Colombo (see below), a colonial-era building that houses an impressive collection of Sri Lankan artifacts and art. VISIT THE STUNNING KELANIYA VIHARAYA TEMPLE \" THE SIN OF A LIFETIME ARE ALL RENDERED NULL ONCE KELANIYA IS WORSHIPED, A SINGLE TIME.” It wasn’t until our third visit to Colombo that we discovered the mesmerising Kelaniya Raja Maha Viharaya Temple. The very definition of hidden gem, Kelaniya Viharaya is a jewel of spirituality and ancient architecture set just outside Colombo. In a city that sometimes feels devoid of history, Kelaniya Viharaya feels like stepping back in time. The temple's history dates back over 2,500 years - according to Buddhist lore, the temple is associated with three significant visits made by Lord Buddha to Sri Lanka, which along with Kandy’s Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic, makes it one of the most revered Buddhist sites in Sri Lanka. Throughout the centuries, the Kelaniya Viharaya has undergone numerous renovations and expansions. The temple was reconstructed in the 3rd century, and further embellished in the 12th century. Unfortunately, the Portuguese destroyed the Viharaya in 1575, and with that, the ornate sculptural work and the paintings perished. What stands today is a mish-mash of Buddhist temples and stupas from the 18th and 20th centuries. The main attraction, the Kelaniya Stupa, stands tall, adorned with ornate decorations that depict stories from Buddhist scriptures. The most impressive part of the temple is the magnificent paintings that adorn the walls of the interior. The colourful murals depict scenes from the life of Lord Buddha and other significant events in Buddhist history and are eye-catching to say the least. Outside the main temple, you'll find a huge Bodhi tree, believed to be a sapling of the revered Bodhi tree in Bodh Gaya, India, under which Lord Buddha attained enlightenment. Its broad canopy provides shade for devotees, who sit, pray and meditate in large numbers. A few things to know before you visit - it’s a 30-minute tuk-tuk ride from downtown Colombo, and while entry is free, donations are welcomed. You’ll need to remove your footwear (wear socks to avoid major burns on your feet), and cover your knees and shoulders). If you wish, you can buy some lotus flowers as you enter the temple as an offering to Buddha. Overall though, Kelaniya Viharaya blew us away, and we highly recommend a visit. THE DETAILS Where | Kelaniya Viharaya How to get there | Tuk Tuk from Colombo town Entry fee | Free (donations welcomed) Note | Cover your knees and shoulders, remove your shoes MARVEL AT GANGARAMAYA TEMPLE In the chaos of Colombo, it’s often hard to find respite. However, one place you’re sure to escape the cacophony of noise is the oasis of Gangaramaya Temple. Founded in the late 1800s, the temple began as a small hermitage on the scenic Beira Lake. Over the years, it has gradually expanded, influenced by diverse architectural styles, into the awe-inspiring sanctuary you see today. Gangaramaya Temple is a somewhat weird yet wonderful fusion of traditional Sri Lankan, Thai, Indian, and Chinese elements, with intricate woodcarvings, impressive stone sculptures, and vibrant murals reflecting the widespread nature of Buddhism across parts of Asia. A spectacular work of art, the Temple is elaborately designed and you’ll notice the differing styles as soon as you walk in - the main building looks like a Victorian-era mansion, while the surrounding wings feel more like the open-air temples of south-east Asian. Inside, there’s a white stupa, a towering Bodhi tree, and a sea of Buddha statues that resembles Borobudur in Indonesia. It’s wonderfully unique, and unlike any temple we’ve visited in South East Asia. The Temple is also home to many of Colombo’s main cultural celebrations, including the annual Nawam Perahera, a grand procession of colour and pageantry that showcases traditional dancers, musicians, and a myriad of exquisitely adorned elephants - which is held in February each year. If you’re around during this time, we highly suggest a visit. Beyond its religious significance, Gangaramaya Temple is a living museum, with a treasure trove of artifacts from ancient weaponry to traditional masks and vintage automobiles, gifted by devoted followers and pilgrims over the years. If you’re short of time in Colombo, we highly recommend visiting Gangaramaya. You can easily visit in an hour or so, and then take in many of Colombo’s other sites in a day. As with other temples in Sri Lanka, you must visitors are advised to dress conservatively and cover their shoulders and the legs below the knee when entering the temple premises. THE DETAILS Where | Gangaramaya Temple, Colombo Entry Fee | LKR 800 for foreigners (USD 2.50) Opening Hours | 6:00 am – 10:00 pm WATCH THE SUNSET AT GALLE FACE GREEN When in Colombo, do as the locals do, and head to Galle Face Green for sunset. What is Galle Face Green we hear you ask? It’s basically a local institution - an ocean-side urban park with stunning ocean views and a vibrant atmosphere that brings locals and tourists alike to witness a golden end to the day. Packed with vendors selling everything from cooked crabs to sliced mango and chilli (a popular Sri Lankan street food!), it’s a great place to grab an afternoon ice cream and watch the locals indulge in their favourite pastimes, from flying kites to playing cricket As night falls, the park comes alive with vibrant energy, and the air is filled the smell of barbequed seafood and with the sound of music as street performers showcase their talents. It’s one of the best places to understand Colombo’s unique cultural pastimes, so we highly recommend spending an afternoon here. THE DETAILS Where | Galle Face Green, Colombo UNDERSTAND SRI LANKAN HISTORY AT THE NATIONAL MUSEUM The National Museum in Colombo is an absolute must-visit for anyone who has a passion for Sri Lanka's rich and diverse history. The museum boasts an impressive collection of artifacts and exhibits that cover the country's ancient kingdoms, colonial periods, and more recent history. Among the major exhibits at the museum are the regalia of the Kandyan kings, which includes the crown, sceptre, and throne of the last king of Sri Lanka, Sri Vikrama Rajasinha. The museum also has a captivating collection of ancient weapons, including swords, daggers, and firearms, as well as a stunning display of traditional Sri Lankan masks used in dance and ritual. Moreover, the National Museum's library is home to an extensive collection of books and manuscripts on Sri Lankan history and culture, making it a valuable resource for researchers and scholars. The library is open to the public, and visiting it is highly recommended. We’d recommend going earlier in the day, although you only need to allocate a couple of hours. THE DETAILS Where | National Museum, Colombo Opening Hours | 9:00 am to 5:00 pm Entry Fees | 200 LKR per person ADMIRE JAMI UL-ALFAR MASJID (RED MOSQUE) Hidden down an unremarkable side street amongst the chaos of Pettah’s streets, the red and white facade of Jami Ul-Alfar Masjid, affectionately known as the Red Mosque, is an architectural highlight in Colombo that captivates those who lay eyes on its jaw-dropping facade. Or at least it’s done that for us each time we’ve laid eyes on it. Despite appearances, construction of the Jami-Ul-Alfar Mosque only began in 1908 and was completed in 1909, commissioned by the local Indian Muslim community in Pettah to fulfil their required daily prayers and Friday Jummah. Its awe-inspiring facade is adorned with red and white candy-striped minarets that reach for the heavens. Once inside, the interior of Jami Ul-Alfar Masjid is a mesmerising fusion of colours and patterns including ornate arabesque designs and exquisitely patterned tiles, with the showpiece being the mosque's vast prayer hall. As a tourist, it is possible to step inside, however, you’ll need to dress appropriately, cover your arms, legs and hair, and visit during strict opening hours (see below). THE DETAILS Where | Jami Ul-Alfar Masjid, Pettah, Colombo Opening Hours | Sat - Thu: 9:30 am - 5:30 pm, Fri: 3 pm - 5:30 pm TAKE A COLOMBO CITY TOUR We’re not usually big city tour fans as we tend to follow our noses and get lost wherever we go. However, in a city like Colombo, such an attitude can lead you astray, and it’s very likely you’ll miss many of the best attractions, as well as the best street food (which is NOT okay!) - this is why we highly recommend taking a city walking tour. Colombo offers a sensory feast, from the vibrant markets and historic architecture to the tranquil temples and stunning ocean views, and the city tour takes you deep into the city’s heart and soul. Led by a legendary (and super knowledgable) local guide, you’ll see all the main sights, including The intricate carvings and sacred relics of Gangaramaya Temple, the vibrant and colourful markets of Pettah district and the mesmerising Jami Ul-Alfar Masjid (Red Mosque), discover the city's heritage at the National Museum, walk through the stunning Kelaniya Viharaya Temple, and enjoy a snack of hoppers and vegetable roti to watching the locals indulge in their favourite pastimes at Galle Face Green. The best part for us, though, is gaining a deeper understanding of the city’s rich history and culture, which is often overlooked by travellers to Sri Lanka - this city is overflowing with layers of history that only a local can share. If you’re keen to book a city tour, this highly recommended 3-hour tour showcases the true essence of Colombo and is super affordable. THE DETAILS BOOK | The True Essence of Colombo city tour ENJOY A SUNDOWNER AT THE HISTORIC MOUNT LAVINIA HOTEL Sri Lankan sunsets rival the best impressionist paintings known to man - they’re a kaleidoscope of colours and textures that leave you mesmerised and wanting more. And the best thing is they happen every.single.night. In our opinion, the best place to watch a sunset, cocktail in hand, is at the historic Mount Lavinia Hotel, perched on the southern outskirts of Colombo. Steeped in history, the hotel was once the residence of the British Governor-General. Today, the hotel's open-air terrace floats above the Indian Ocean, providing endless views of Colombo’s coastline and the shimmering ocean - and it’s here we recommend grabbing yourself a gin & tonic, enjoying the cooling sea breeze, and watching nature do its thang. As the sun dips below the horizon, casting a golden glow over the shimmering waters of the Indian Ocean, there's no better place to savour the magic of the moment. If you’re keen to indulge in a dinner on the terrace post-sunset, there’s also one of Sri Lanka’s best buffets available here at the Governor’s Lounge. THE DETAILS Where | Mount Lavinia Hotel, Mount Lavinia, Colombo Opening Hours | All day - Happy Hour from 6 pm – 7 pm SEETHAWAKA WET ZONE BOTANIC GARDENS On our latest trip to Sri Lanka, we decided to escape the hustle of downtown Colombo and spent a day exploring some of the verdant outskirts of the city, stopping at the wonderful Seethawaka Wet Zone Botanic Gardens in the process. Located in Avissawella, amongst Sri Lanka’s ‘wet zone’, the garden was designed to conserve Sri Lanka’s ‘wet zone’ flo", "images":

Learn about the different modes of transportation including train, bus, and taxi, and choose the best option for you and start exploring the cultural capital of Sri Lanka. Kandy is Sri Lanka’s City of Kings, second city and the island’s undisputed historical and cultural capital. Filled with many well-known attractions, Kandy is a city of delightful chaos, with its bustling streets, ancient temples, colonial architecture, aristocratic gardens and the glorious Kandy lake forming the backdrop to a perfect few days amongst Sri Lanka 's lush green hills. The gateway to all of this hill-country action , Kandy is an essential stop when travelling through Sri Lanka, and getting from Colombo to Kandy is both easy and affordable. Below is our detailed guide on getting from Colombo to Kandy, which covers all transport options to suit all budget types, from super cheap local buses and scenic train rides to more luxurious private transfer options.

Edit like us with our Tropical Dreams Preset Packs , and Tropical Bliss mobile video filters, inspired by the tropical beauty and colour of this beautiful country GETTING FROM COLOMBO TO KANDY CHEAPEST | Local bus from Colombo Fort/Pettah to Kandy QUICKEST | Private transfer (expensive), or Express Bus (affordable) OUR RECOMMENDATION | The Colombo to Kandy train through the hills and jungles COLOMBO TO KANDY TRAIN The most scenic way to get from Colombo to Kandy is via train, which runs through dense jungle and picturesque villages for the majority of the journey. It’s a seriously scenic journey that is almost comparable to the Kandy to Ella train. The Colombo Fort to Kandy train departs 10 times a day, with the earliest departure at 6:55 am and the final departure at 19:30. The train journey takes around 2.5 - 3.5 hours. WHERE IS COLOMBO FORT STATION? Colombo Fort station is located in the centre of Colombo, right in the heart of the central business and commercial district. This bustling, chaotic and lively part of the city is a little overwhelming at first, so you need to keep your wits about you, however, once inside the station, you’ll feel a little more relaxed as you wait for your train. There are heaps of food stalls on the outside of the station if you need to stock up on food and water for the train ride. COLOMBO TO KANDY TRAIN DEPARTURE TIMES & ROUTE Departure times from Colombo Fort to Kandy are as follows: 05:55*, 07:00, 08:30*, 10:35, 12:40*, 15:35, 16:35* (Not on Saturday or Sunday), 17:15, 17:45* It’s important to know that the Colombo to Kandy route is extremely busy, especially during rush hours when people are going to and from work. We suggest travelling outside the peak hours between 08:30 - 15:35, and 17:35 onwards - 14:00; 16:30 - 19:00. NOTE | Daily departures listed. Check the most up-to-date timetable information on the Sri Lankan Railways website here *Express train - Highlight times are daily departures COLOMBO TO KANDY TRAIN TICKET PRICES Overall, train travel in Sri Lanka is highly affordable, though some big differences in pricing depending on which class ticket you’re after. From Colombo to Kandy , prices are as follows: Third class | LKR 240 Second class | LKR 500 First class | LKR 7,000 *Prices applicable as of Jan 2023 BOOK | Book your Colombo to Kandy train tickets here | book at least 32 days in advance HOW TO BOOK YOUR TICKET FOR THE COLOMBO TO KANDY TRAIN The process for booking your ticket depends upon whether you’re travelling on an unreserved or reserved ticket: RESERVED TICKETS Reserved seating cannot be purchased on your day of travel, so you must book reserved tickets 32 days ahead of your departure date . You can book your tickets here In the off-season, you can probably get away with booking these at your departure station a few days ahead of time - otherwise, we suggest booking at least a month in advance to secure your seat BOOK | You can book online (32 days before) here ) UNRESERVED TICKETS Unreserved tickets cannot be purchased before the day of travel. It’s simply a matter of showing up at the station a bit earlier and queueing at the ticket office. Unreserved tickets also can’t sell out - they’re uncapped. If you’re told that tickets have sold out, it’s probably because the seller has assumed that as a foreigner, you’d prefer a reserved seat. You can always buy an unreserved ticket. If you prefer winging your travels, we suggest getting to the station at least 2 hours prior to departure to purchase your tickets (but seriously, just buy them online ) and save yourself the hassle!) SRI LANKAN TRAIN CLASSES & AMENITIES Reserved or unreserved? First class or third class? When it comes to buying tickets for your train ride in Sri Lanka , the different ticket options can initially be a little confusing. Personally, we strongly believe that this train ride is one of the rare times where the best experience is actually found in the lower ticket classes. First class is stuffy with windows and doors that won’t open and mostly other foreigners occupying the seats next to. Second and third class on the other hand, are a truly authentic taste of what life is really like for locals on the Sri Lankan railway system. Here’s a quick breakdown of what each class entails (keep reading for costs!): THIRD CLASS UNRESERVED Third Class Unreserved are the cheapest tickets available for the train, and as such, tend to be the most popular with locals too. The seating here is non-allocated wooden benches (it’s basically a free for all!) so be prepared that at least some of your journey will involve standing. For all that the journey may be a little uncomfortable though, this is where the most authentic taste of Sri Lankan life can be found though. Groups of local boys sing and play the drums, big families crowd together on one or two benches, sharing meals and passing little ones across the carriage for the best views, while vendors squeeze past with precariously balanced trays of deep-fried delights. The mood is jovial and everyone’s keen to chat - it’s just a super happy place to be! THIRD CLASS RESERVED Exactly as above, but with the difference of allocated seating. It’s a little less chaotic, but the mood is just as fun. This is probably our favourite place to be on the Sri Lankan rail network, as it comes with all the fun and local interaction of third class, but with the slightly more organised aspect of having a (mostly) guaranteed seat. You can also open the windows and doors here, and the doorways don’t tend to be as crowded as you may find in the unreserved carriages - perfect for dangling your feet over and feeling the wind through your hair! BOOK | Secure your third-class reserved ticket here SECOND CLASS UNRESERVED A little softer than third-class seating-wise, though in a stuffy carriage with hard seating, this doesn’t really make too much of an impact! Not too much more expensive than the third class, but again, you’ll probably need to push your way onto the train for this one. These seats tend to be great if you’re travelling in the off or shoulder seasons, as the trains are a lot less busy then. We’ve taken this option to Galle and managed to find a seat after Hikkaduwa - standing was kinda fun, but we did miss a lot of the beautiful coastline vistas. SECOND CLASS RESERVED As above, with allocated seating this time. The price jump for reserved seating in this carriage is about half again of what you’d pay for the other classes, but if you’re travelling during peak season and you know your travel dates in advance, it’s absolutely worth booking these well ahead of your arrival to Sri Lanka (read our top Sri Lanka travel tips for more handy tips). Note that these will often sell out 1-2 months in advance during peak season, so booking online is the best option. TIP | We recommend second class reserved for the Colombo to Galle train - book here FIRST CLASS Allocated plush(ish) seating, privacy, and air conditioning are the main features here. We absolutely wouldn’t recommend this carriage if you’re wanting to get a real feel for the train ride though; the windows and doors remain locked, and you’ll be rubbing shoulders mostly with other foreigners. It’s not exactly the most authentic way to experience the country or the train, but if you’ve already taken a few train journeys and just want to get to your destination comfortably, this might be the option for you. NOTE | At present, there is only one first class train per day servicing the Colombo to Galle route THERE ARE TOILETS ON BOARD There are toilets on board the trains, and while they’re definitely not the greatest we’ve ever encountered, they’re also not the worst. They are squat toilets - so best avoided on particularly windy parts of the track - and always take some toilet paper in with you, as we’re yet to encounter any that provide it! COLOMBO TO KANDY BUS If trains aren't your thing, or you're on a strict budget, you can catch the public bus from Colombo bus station to Kandy easily. If you've managed to snag a window seat (generally impossible on Sri Lankan buses), the drive from Colombo to Kandy is in many ways more spectacular than the train ride, as the road snakes its way through the countryside, rolling up and down before making the final ascent into the hill country. Be warned though, the final few hours through the suburbs of Kandy are a hard, long slog! WHERE IS PETTAH (BASTIAN MAWATHA) BUS STATION Bastian Mawatha Bus station is located in downtown Colombo, right next to the bustling Pettah Markets. It’s super easy to get to from anywhere in Colombo, as it is where most transport options depart from, including the Colombo Fort train station. COLOMBO TO KANDY BUS TICKET PRICES PUBLIC BUS A one-way ticket from Pettah station to Kandy (bus #1) is around LKR 155 (around $0.50 USD). This is a non-A/C service. A/C BUS A one-way ticket on the airconditioned service to Kandy is LKR 3,300 (around $9 USD). Book in advance here NOTE | Price as of 2023. Prices change regularly in Sri Lanka, especially with the current economic and fuel issues COLOMBO TO KANDY BUS TICKET DEPARTURE TIMES PUBLIC BUS Departure times for the public bus from Pettah central bus station to Kandy vary greatly, but services leave frequently 24 hours a day. Simply arrive at the bus station, ask around and there will be a bus departing soon enough. Public buses generally take 4+ hours to complete the journey, are super crowded, and stop frequently. NOTE | We were unable to find an up to date departure schedule A/C BUS Departure times for the A/C bus from Pettah central bus station to Kandy are: 00:15, 10:00, 11:00, 15:00, 17:00 The A/C bus generally takes 4 hours for the 160km journey. HOW TO BOOK YOUR COLOMBO TO KANDY BUS TICKET Tickets for the Number 1 bus from Colombo to Kandy can be purchased from the conductor on the bus, so there’s a need to purchase in advance. If you wish to purchase an A/C bus in advance, you can book here . BOOK | A/C Bus from Colombo to Kandy TAXI / PRIVATE TRANSFER If you’re no longer a backpacker, and the days of catching long trains are behind you, there is a comfortable and efficient way to get to Kandy - via private transfer or taxi. For a small (read: large) fee, you can be transferred directly from your Colombo hotel (or airport) directly to your accommodation in Kandy. In fact, if you’re arriving to Sri Lanka and aren’t keen on staying in Colombo (or your flight arrives in the wee hours), this is definitely the best option. The travel time to the coast is around 3.15 hrs (the expressway is faster and therefore cheaper), and, while the fee differs from provider to provider, will likely cost LKR 9,000 + ($100 USD - $150). Hotels in Colombo can organise your transfer or taxi for you, while there’s a desk at Colombo airport for new arrivals to arrange their transport (here, the price is fixed and somewhat bloated). Alternatively, we recommend booking in advance with a trusted provider here . BOOK | Colombo to Kandy private transfer KANDY TRAVEL INFORMATION WHERE IS KANDY? Set amongst the misty hills and dense forests of Sri Lanka's central province, Kandy is located about three hours northeast of the capital of Colombo. Kandy is one of the largest and most culturally significant cities in Sri Lanka , with a population of around 110,000 calling the city home. WHEN TO VISIT KANDY, SRI LANKA Due to its position in the mountainous central region of Sri Lanka, Kandy has a wetter and cooler climate than most of the country. For optimal weather conditions, we recommend visiting Kandy between January and April . Although the weather may be slightly warmer and humid, the days will be (mostly) rain free. From May to July, and from October to December, the region experiences its two monsoon seasons, during which time the weather is wetter and more volatile. We visited Kandy in both April and November, and while both times of year were manageable, November was far wetter, which made it a lot harder to see everything we wanted. On the plus side, it was devoid of tourists and easier to see most attractions. It's worth noting that the Sinhalese New Year occurs during the middle of April, which can make getting to Kandy (or anywhere in Sri Lanka) a huge problem, so we'd advise avoiding travelling to Sri Lanka over this period. WHERE TO STAY IN KANDY As it’s the cultural capital of Sri Lanka, accommodation for all budgets in Kandy is quite easy to come by We’ve recommended three hotels below, but you can also search for all hotel options for Kandy, Sri Lanka using Booking.com .

Narrow, bustling laneways and crumbling colonial-era relics, an ever-present scent of spices and the incredible tropical setting; there’s just something about Galle Fort that charms and captivates. Due to its beauty and popularity, it’s an essential stop when travelling through Sri Lanka, and getting from Colombo to Galle is both easy and affordable. Below is our detailed guide on getting from Colombo to Galle, which covers all transport options to suit all budget types, from super cheap local buses and scenic train rides to more luxurious private transfer options. However you get there, the alluring and exotic Galle Fort is one of the unmissable points of interest on your Sri Lankan itinerary . LOVE OUR PHOTOS?

The Colombo Fort to Galle train departs 10 times a day, with the earliest departure at 6:55 am and the final departure at 19:30. The train journey takes around 2.5 - 3.5 hours. WHERE IS COLOMBO FORT STATION? Colombo Fort station is located in the centre of Colombo, right in the heart of the central business and commercial district. This bustling, chaotic and lively part of the city is a little overwhelming at first, so you need to keep your wits about you, however, once inside the station, you’ll feel a little more relaxed as you wait for your train. There are heaps of food stalls on the outside of the station if you need to stock up on food and water for the train ride. COLOMBO TO GALLE TRAIN DEPARTURE TIMES & ROUTE From Colombo Fort | 6:50*, 8:35*, 10:30*, 14:40, 15:50*, 17:51, 19:30 From Maradana Station | 06:25*, 14:30, 15:40*, 18:45 *Express train NOTE | Daily departures listed. Check the most up-to-date timetable information on the Sri Lankan Railways website here It’s important to know that the Colombo to Galle route is one of the busiest in Sri Lanka, especially during rush hours, when people are going to and from work. We suggest travelling outside the peak hours between 07:00 - 09:30; 12:30 - 14:00; 16:30 - 19:00. COLOMBO TO GALLE TRAIN TICKET PRICES Overall, train travel in Sri Lanka is extremely affordable, though there are some big differences in pricing depending on which class ticket you’re after. From Colombo to Galle, prices are as follows: Third class | LKR 240 / £ / USD Second class | LKR 500 / £ / USD First class | LKR 990 / £ / USD BOOK | You can book train tickets online (32 days before) here HOW TO BOOK YOUR TICKET FOR THE COLOMBO TO GALLE TRAIN The process for booking your ticket depends upon whether you’re travelling on an unreserved or reserved ticket: RESERVED TICKETS Reserved seating cannot be purchased on your day of travel, so you must book reserved tickets ahead of time . In the off-season, you can probably get away with booking these at your departure station a few days ahead of time - otherwise, we suggest booking at least a month in advance to secure your seat. BOOK | You can book train tickets online (32 days before) here UNRESERVED TICKETS Unreserved tickets cannot be purchased before the day of travel. It’s simply a matter of showing up at the station a bit earlier and queueing at the ticket office. Unreserved tickets also can’t sell out - they’re uncapped. If you’re told that tickets have sold out, it’s probably because the seller has assumed that as a foreigner, you’d prefer a reserved seat. You can always buy an unreserved ticket. If you prefer winging your travels, we suggest getting to the station at least 2 hours prior to departure to purchase your tickets (but seriously, just buy them online ) and save yourself the hassle!) SRI LANKAN TRAIN CLASSES & AMENITIES Reserved or unreserved? First class or third class? When it comes to buying tickets for your train ride in Sri Lanka , the different ticket options can initially be a little confusing. Personally, we strongly believe that this train ride is one of the rare times where the best experience is actually found in the lower ticket classes. First class is stuffy with windows and doors that won’t open and mostly other foreigners occupying the seats next to. Second and third class on the other hand, are a truly authentic taste of what life is really like for locals on the Sri Lankan railway system. Here’s a quick breakdown of what each class entails (keep reading for costs!): THIRD CLASS UNRESERVED Third Class Unreserved are the cheapest tickets available for the train, and as such, tend to be the most popular with locals too. The seating here is non-allocated wooden benches (it’s basically a free for all!) so be prepared that at least some of your journey will involve standing. For all that the journey may be a little uncomfortable though, this is where the most authentic taste of Sri Lankan life can be found though. Groups of local boys sing and play drums, big families crowd together on one or two benches, sharing meals and passing little ones across the carriage for the best views, while vendors squeeze past with precariously balanced trays of deep-fried delights. The mood is jovial and everyone’s keen to chat - it’s just a super happy place to be! THIRD CLASS RESERVED Exactly as above, but with the difference of allocated seating. It’s a little less chaotic, but the mood is just as fun. This is probably our favourite place to be on the Sri Lankan rail network, as it comes with all the fun and local interaction of third class, but with the slightly more organised aspect of having a (mostly) guaranteed seat. You can also open the windows and doors here, and the doorways don’t tend to be as crowded as you may find in the unreserved carriages - perfect for dangling your feet over and feeling the wind through your hair! BOOK | Secure your third class reserved ticket here SECOND CLASS UNRESERVED A little softer than third class seating-wise, though in a stuffy carriage with hard seating this doesn’t really make too much of an impact! Not too much more expensive than the third class, but again, you’ll probably need to push your way onto the train for this one. These seats tend to be great if you’re travelling in the off or shoulder seasons, as the trains are a lot less busy then. We’ve taken this option to Galle and managed to find a seat after Hikkaduwa - standing was kinda fun, but we did miss a lot of the beautiful coastline vistas. SECOND CLASS RESERVED As above, with allocated seating this time. The price jump for reserved seating in this carriage is about half again of what you’d pay for the other classes, but if you’re travelling during peak season and you know your travel dates in advance, it’s absolutely worth booking these well ahead of your arrival to Sri Lanka (read our top Sri Lanka travel tips for more handy tips). Note that these will often sell out 1-2 months in advance during peak season, so booking online is the best option. TIP | We recommend second class reserved for the Colombo to Galle train - book here FIRST CLASS Allocated plush(ish) seating, privacy, and air conditioning are the main features here. We absolutely wouldn’t recommend this carriage if you’re wanting to get a real feel for the train ride though; the windows and doors remain locked, and you’ll be rubbing shoulders mostly with other foreigners. It’s not exactly the most authentic way to experience the country or the train, but if you’ve already taken a few train journeys and just want to get to your destination comfortably, this might be the option for you. NOTE | At present, there is only one first class train per day servicing the Colombo to Galle route THERE ARE TOILETS ON BOARD There are toilets on board the trains, and while they’re definitely not the greatest we’ve ever encountered, they’re also not the worst. They are squat toilets - so best avoided on particularly windy parts of the track - and always take some toilet paper in with you, as we’re yet to encounter any that provide it! COLOMBO TO GALLE EXPRESS BUS If you prefer your creature comforts (air-conditioning), there’s a direct express bus (bus #EX001) from Makumbura bus station (formerly Maharagama bus station) in the suburbs of Colombo to Galle, which follows the newly completed inland highway. You’re guaranteed a seat, and the air-conditioning is a welcome relief in Sri Lanka. WHERE IS MAKUMBURA STATION Makumbura bus station is located in the eastern outskirts of Colombo city, and serves as a departure point for express buses to the south. To get there, we recommend taking a tuk-tuk or taxi (organise through PickMe - expect to pay LKR 400 - LKR 900 ($5 - $10 USD), given the distance from the city centre. For a cheaper option, you can jump on a bus (line 138) from Bastiyan Mawatha bus stand, which should take around 1 hour. The newly built Makumbura bus station has several amenities, such as toilets, and food and drink stands. COLOMBO TO GALLE BUS TICKET PRICES A one-way ticket from Colombo Makumbura station to Galle is LKR 2000 (around $7 USD). When added to the tuk-tuk/taxi fare, the total cost can be upwards of LKR 1000 ($10 USD). NOTE | Price as of 2025. Prices change regularly in Sri Lanka, especially with the current economic and fuel issues HOW TO BOOK YOUR TICKET FOR THE COLOMBO TO GALLE BUS Tickets can be purchased from the conductor on the bus, so there’s a need to purchase them in advance. If you wish to purchase in advance, book here. COLOMBO TO GALLE BUS DEPARTURE TIMES & ROUTE Busses run from Makumbura station to Galle from 5 am every 20 minutes daily with the last bus leaving at 21:00 pm. STANDARD BUS FROM BASTIAN MAWATHA BUS STATION If you’re on a strict budget, there is a bus that travels along the west coast to the south, from Bastian Mawatha Bus station in Colombo (next to Pettah Markets) to Galle. We’ve taken this route many times, and while it’s long, hot and bumpy (it can take upwards of 4 hrs), it’s super cheap (LKR 170 / $2 USD) and provides epic views and real cultural experiences. But we’ve not provided a full overview of this route because we, unfortunately, don’t have up-to-date information, and we think there are better options listed above. PRIVATE TRANSFER / TAXI If you’re no longer a backpacker, and the days of catching long trains are behind you, there is a comfortable and efficient way to get to Galle - via private transfer or taxi. For a small (read: large) fee, you can be transferred directly from your Colombo hotel (or airport) directly to your accommodation in Galle. In fact, if you’re arriving to Sri Lanka and aren’t keen on staying in Colombo (or your flight arrives in the wee hours), this is definitely the best option. The travel time to the coast is around 2 - 2.5 hrs (the expressway is faster and therefore cheaper), and, while the fee differs from provider to provider, will likely cost LKR 9,000 + ($100 USD - $150). Hotels in Colombo can organise your transfer or taxi for you, while there’s a desk at Colombo airport for new arrivals to arrange their transport (here, the price is fixed and somewhat bloated). Alternatively, book in advance with a trusted provider here . PLAN YOUR VISIT TO GALLE WHERE IS GALLE FORT? Beautiful Galle Fort is located in the city of Galle in the southwest corner of Sri Lanka , around 110km from the capital, Colombo, and just a short drive to some of Sri Lanka’s popular beachside enclaves, including Hikkaduwa, Unawatuna , and Mirissa. Situated on a rocky peninsula, the sea surrounds Galle Fort from three sides, making it a wonderful location for a Fort. HOW LONG DO YOU NEED IN GALLE FORT?

We’ve spent almost eight weeks exploring all corners of Sri Lanka, enjoying endless white-sand beaches with pumping surf, lush tropical jungles and misty mountain towns , ancient World Heritage sites and safari plains where Asian Elephants and Leopards roam in abundance. We’ve taken enchanting train rides through rolling tea plantations, and enjoyed the vibrant cultural heritage this island has. And we’ve met the friendliest locals we could ever hope to meet. And we’ve done it all with camera in hand, capturing every moment (follow our Sri Lanka itinerary !). These are a collection of our favourite Sri Lanka photos from our two trips to this stunning island nation. A photographic journey through Sri Lanka | our top Sri Lanka photos Sri Lanka’s natural beauty For a country so small, Sri Lanka’s natural beauty is astounding. Surrounded by the Indian Ocean, Sri Lanka’s coast is lined with palm-lined, golden beaches ( Hiriketiya is our fave!), while the interior posses a wide range of natural landscapes, from the wildlife-rich jungles of Yala National Park, to the verdant, misty hills of Ella and surrounds . Even the sunsets are among the best we’ve seen, anywhere in the world! Everywhere we went, we were be blown away by this country’s stunning scenery. Adventure in Sri Lanka’s misty mountains | everything to do in Ella Daily life in Sri Lanka There’s always something going on in Sri Lanka . The colourful streets are abuzz 24 hours a day, from vendors selling ripe king coconuts, to tuk tuk drivers beeping their way through traffic. Conversations on street corners are common (it’s as though everyone knows each other in Sri Lanka!), as are bustling markets seemingly every 500m. Daily life in Sri Lanka is intoxicating. Exploring the incredible Galle Fort The people of Sri Lanka Ask anyone who’s visited Sri Lanka and they’ll agree - the people here are the friendliest in the world. We’ve had tuk tuk drivers surprise us with coconuts on long drives, fellow passengers help us manoeuvre our bags (and selves) into safer positions on overcrowded trains, families welcome us into their homes for tea and a chat, and people go out of their way time and time again, of their own accord, to make sure we felt welcome. It’s a pretty special thing to experience, and it’s one of the reasons we love Sri Lanka so dearly. From the genuine and welcoming smiles and head bobbles, to the generous and welcoming nature, we’ve only had positive experiences in Sri Lanka. Our top Sri Lanka Travel tips | Everything you need to know before you go Scenes from Sri Lankan Train journey’s Riding trains in Sri Lanka is pure and simple joy. From the iconic Kandy to Ella train , which winds through some of Sri Lanka’s most stunning scenery, to the picturesque coastal express from Colombo to Galle, and the long, rickety north to south trip from Jaffna to Colombo, there’s always incredible memories to be made on Sri Lankan rail journeys. We’ve clocked over 20 train rides in Sri Lanka, and these are some of our favourite images captured aboard. Our essential guide to Sri Lanka’s Kandy to Ella train ride Tropical vibes from Sri Lanka’s southern coast From Unawatuna to Hiriketiya and everywhere in between, the whole southern coast of Sri Lanka is paradise; think palm-fringed golden sands flanked by tropical jungle and awesome surf breaks dotted along the coast. It’s little wonder why Sri Lanka attracts bronzed surfers riding waves all day long, and salty-haired wanderers chilling into a new level of zen from all over the world. It doesn’t quite have the ‘it’ factor of Bali (and it's insane waterfalls ) or the mass-tourism of Thailand , thankfully, but this underrated coastline won’t stay quiet for much longer. A surfers Paradise | the best things to do in Hiriketiya, Sri Lanka Sri Lanka’s Unexplored north Often skipped over by travellers to Sri Lanka, Jaffna is a seriously raw and authentic place to visit. These northern realms of Sri Lanka drum to a beat of their own, lead by the strong Hindu culture of the Tamils. The language is distinct, the people more reserved, and the cuisine influenced strongly by southern India. The region, finally rebuilding and healing after a bloody 26 year civil war that only ended in 2009, still bears the scars from this tumultuous period. Yet despite it all, Jaffna has an incredible amount of unique things to see and do , including ancient forts and temples, isolated islands, and truly amazing food. The region’s still a while away from truly exploding as a tourism destination, but for those like us who were searching for an authentic travel experience, Jaffna is definitely a place we recommend you visit in Sri Lanka . Exploring Jaffna and the North | our travellers guide to Jaffna, Sri Lanka The best Travel photography gear For Sri Lanka Sri Lanka is a seriously photogenic country, so we definitely recommend investing in some good photography gear before visiting. Below is the photography gear we used to get all of our shots in Sri Lanka. The Sony A7RII produces brilliant photos and video The original photography beast which keeps going strong, the Canon 5D MKIII produces the best colours The Canon 24-70mm is known as one of the best zoom lenses on the market; it's exceptionally sharp, small and lightweight, which makes it perfect for travel photography The Canon 70-200mm f4 is our favourite lens, hands down. The image stabilisation works a treat, even on moving trains! Check out the rest of camera gear here. If you like our photography, be sure to follow us on Instagram , too.

From the very best things to do in Sri Lanka’s cultural capital, to where to stay, our top tips, and how to get around, we’ve got you covered. Many travellers come to Sri Lanka for the white-sand beaches and epic surf; but right at the island’s mountainous emerald-swathed heart lies a spiritual, charming area full of tea plantations, misty hills, and those famous blue train carriages. The gateway to all of this hill-country action (and the greatest train journey in the world!) is Kandy; City of Kings, Sri Lanka’s second city and the island’s undisputed historical and cultural capital. Protected by its geographic position and less-accessible terrain, the powerful ancient Kingdom of Kandy was able to hold off the advancement of both the Portuguese and Dutch colonisers through the 1500s and 1600s, becoming the last standing bastion of independent Ceylon. In doing so, the city was able to preserve the unique customs, culture, and arts that had been heavily subdued elsewhere in the country - until 1815 when it finally succumbed to British rule. Today, that cultural preservation lives on in the city’s many significant cultural and historic sites, forming the basis for all the very best places to visit in Kandy. The best-known of these is the Temple of the Tooth relic; Buddhism’s most important religious shrine, and said to be the location of a portion of Buddha’s tooth. But Kandy is also so much more than its number one attraction; it's a city of delightful chaos, with its bustling streets, ancient temples, colonial architecture, aristocratic gardens and the glorious Kandy lake forming the backdrop to a perfect few days amongst Sri Lanka 's lush green hills. There are so many great things to see and do in Kandy, and we highly recommend spending a few days in the city to take it all in. LOVE OUR PHOTOS?

We’ve recommended three hotels below, but you can also read our full guide to the best hotels in Kandy , plus area guide. W15 HANTHANA ESTATE KANDY An elegant relic of the colonial era, W15 Hanthana Estate is a 9-bedroom plantation-style bungalow that has been totally restyled in recent years, evoking a sense of timeless luxury for the discerning traveller today. The service is exceptional, as are the amenities (that pool), but it comes with a price. BOOK | W15 Hanthana Estate THE RADH, KANDY At The Radh , luxury doesn’t come with a hefty price tag. Offering the best of elegance and affordability right in the heart of Kandy, The Radh is the ideal choice for seeing all the attractions downtown, including the famed Temple of the Tooth. BOOK | The Radh, Kandy HELGA’S FOLLY Decorated in a whimsical theme with original Sri Lankan artwork and murals, Helga’s Folly is certainly the most unique place you’ll stay in Kandy, if not the whole of Sri Lanka. The childhood home of glittering high-society owner, Helga de Silva Blow Perera, this eclectic hotel has been attracting artists, free spirits, and notable celebrities alike for decades, with a guest list that includes Gregory Peck, Mahatma Gandhi, Laurence Olivier, and Kelly Jones, lead singer of the Stereophonics whose stay inspired the stay ‘Madame Helga’. It’s creative and bizarre and bordering on unhinged, and you’ll definitely either love it or hate a stay here - but that’s all part of its intrigue! BOOK | Helga’s Folly KEEP PLANNING | Where to stay in Kandy, Sri Lanka THE BEST THINGS TO DO IN KANDY, SRI LANKA #1 TEMPLE OF THE SACRED TOOTH RELIC, KANDY Never has a decaying tooth held so much significance to so many people, yet that’s exactly the reason that the impressive Temple of the Sacred Tooth and Royal Complex (Sri Dalada Maligawa) is the number one attraction in Kandy. This ornate golden-roofed temple houses the most important Buddhist relic in Sri Lanka - a tooth of Buddha brought to the island in the 4th century. The temple was built between 1867 and 1707 specifically to honour this sacred relic, and the temple has long since been a place of importance for both Sri Lankan and international visitors. In fact, most Sri Lankans believe they need to visit the temple at least once in their lives to pay homage to the toothy treasure. Needless to say, visiting the relic was our top mission on our first visit to Kandy in 2016. Alas, due to mistiming our entry (standard team TCW mistake-making right there!) and the very brief viewing times, our wish wasn’t granted. That said, the mission wasn’t a complete failure; the temple with its ornate carvings and colourful depictions of Buddha blew our minds. Inside the main shrine, devotees file slowly through the various rooms on their way to the casket, bending to leave offerings and pray quietly below the elaborate Buddhist murals. It’s a deeply spiritual place, and a quiet reverence floods each room. If you visit during the annual Esala Perahera (Festival of the Tooth), you may see the tooth’s gilded casket paraded around the city accompanied by 65 colourfully decorated elephants (which we obviously don’t condone - read why here ). THE DETAILS Where | Temple of the Sacred Tooth and Royal Complex (Sri Dalada Maligawa), Kandy Cost | LKR 1,500 per person, or LKR 1,000 from SAARC countries Tips | Both females and males need to cover up legs and shoulders. Shoes must be removed before entering the temple BUCKET LIST | 31 Incredible things to do in Sri Lanka #2 ROYAL BOTANIC GARDENS/PERADENIYA SRI LANKA We're big fans of sprawling city parks, and the Royal Botanic Gardens of Peradeniya, the largest and most extensive in Sri Lanka, are amongst the best we've visited anywhere in the world. If these gardens feel insanely grand, it’s because they were formerly reserved exclusively for Kandyan royals to stroll through before they were transformed into the Botanic Gardens in1821 at the behest of the ruling British. Today, even measly commoners like us are allowed to wander the grounds, which are now home to over 10,000 trees spread across 60 hectares. The gardens also showcase all of Sri Lanka’s unique flora along with representative species from all around the tropical world. We definitely recommend visiting the impressive and totally insta-worthy avenue of royal palms; a beautiful tree-lined pathway in the interior of the gardens. The famous Orchid garden and otherworldly Cannonball tree, planted by King George and Queen Mary during their visit in 1901, are also absolutely worth the visit. When you’re done sightseeing, there are also a number of expansive lawns in which to relax and escape the Sri Lankan heat. As one of the best places to visit in Kandy, We recommend including the gardens in a day tour itinerary, or as part of the three-temple tour (see below). THE DETAILS Where | Royal Botanical Gardens of Peradeniya Cost | LKR 1,500 per person entry How to get to Royal Botanical Gardens of Peradeniya | You can hire a tuk tuk to the gardens for around LKR 400, or include the gardens in a Kandy day tour itinerary. A cheaper alternative is to catch the number 644 bus from near the Kandy Clock Tower, which will take you directly to the garden, for around LKR 20. #3 KANDY CULTURAL DANCE SHOW We’ve got to admit, we tend to give ‘cultural shows’ a wide berth when travelling. Often, they feel like the commercialisation of a culture, an ill-conceived attempt at tourist dollars then falls flat. However, after attending the spectacular Aarti Festival in Nepal, we decided to move our grievances aside and visit the Kandy Cultural Dance Show . And what a show. The artistic show, filled with incredible costumes, dances, acrobatics and fire walking, was a seriously stimulating experience from start to finish, and one we couldn’t keep our eyes off. We witnessed many Sri Lankan dance types such as Magul Bera, Puja Natuma, Devol Natuma, which are techniques unique to areas of the island and are usually passed on from generation to generation, and each dance provides a unique insight into Sri Lanka’s long cultural background. The dances depict a range of cultural experiences, such as the majestic walk of the elephant, the colourful performance of the peacock and the mystical movements of the cobra. A 35+ year institution, the Kandy Cultural Dance Show is one of the best things to do in Kandy. The show starts at 5:30 pm daily, and is housed close to Kandy lake at the Kandy Lake Club. We highly recommend booking tickets in advance, which you can do here THE DETAILS Where | Kandy Lake Club Cost | 1,250 LKR per person Opening Hours | From 5.30 PM daily BOOK | Kandy Cultural Dance Show Tickets SURF’S UP | the best things to see and do in Unawatuna #4 VISIT THE HISTORIC THREE-TEMPLE LOOP OF KANDY The Temple of the Sacred Tooth relic might be the most important of Kandy’s temples, but it’s definitely not the only temple worth visiting. Jump in a tuk-tuk and get out of the hustle and bustle of downtown Kandy for the day to the lush countryside of Gampola, where numerous Kandyan-era temples and shrines still stand proudly over green fields and quiet winding lanes. Three of these temples, Gadaladeniya Viharaya, Embekke, and Lankathilaka form the aptly named 'three temple loop', and serve as a living history of Sri Lanka's extensive Buddhist heritage and craftsmanship. We recommend visiting the three temple loop and The Royal Botanic Gardens of Peradeniya in one day as part of a tuk-tuk tour (this tour is highly rated and 100% worth it). GALADENIYA VIHARAYA Dating from the 14th century, Gadaladeniya Viharaya is built of stone on a rock cliff and contains gilded, seated Buddha statues. In the centre of the temple lies the Banyan tree, as well as ponds formed on the rock face. During our visit, we were able to speak with the temple manager, who told us all about the temple's varied history. He's also a very talented artist, should you want to buy some Sri Lankan art. EMBEKKE DEVALAYA Embekke Devalaya was built in the 14th century by King Vikramabahu III, and is dedicated to the Hindu deity Mahasen. The temples are famous for their carved wooden pillars, which depict both humans and animals, as well as its three main three sections, the ‘Sanctum of Garagha’, the ‘Dancing Hall’ and the ‘Drummers’ Hall’, which houses the best carvings. LANKATHILAKA The final, and in our opinion, most impressive temple in outer Kandy is Lankathilaka Vihara . Perched on a rocky outcrop, this 14th-century temple is one-half Buddhist, one-half Hindu, and incorporates a number of historically significant relics, including a seated Buddha image, rock-face inscriptions featuring both Sinhala and Tamil section, and stone Elephant figures. Set amongst forests, rice fields and a small village, Lankathilaka is one temple we recommend you don't miss. THE DETAILS Where | Gadaladeniya Viharaya , Embekke Devalaya , and Lankathilaka Vihara , outer Kandy Cost | Each temple costs LKR 300 per person BOOK | This immerse day tour takes in the three-temple loop #5 BAHIRAWAKANDA VIHARA BUDDHA STATUE The beautiful Bahirawakanda buddha statue sits atop Bahirawa Kanda hill as if overseeing the daily life of Kandyans below. Built in 1972, the sculpted white statue is one of the tallest in Sri Lanka (at 27m in height), and can be seen from just about anywhere in Kandy. Bahirawakanda offers incredible panoramic views over the green and blue hues of Kandy and beyond and is best to visit at sunset when the city is bathed in a golden glow as the sun drops behind the mountains in the distance. As always, remember to remove shoes and hats before entering the temple complex. THE DETAILS Where | Bahirawakanda buddha statue, Kandy Cost | LKR 250 entry per person kandy day tour | our guide to the incredible pidurangala rock #6 KANDY TO ELLA TRAIN RIDE They say that the journey is what counts, not the destination - and we have to admit, when it comes to Sri Lanka they may just be right. That’s not to say that the destinations in the teardrop isle aren’t incredible (they are!); it’s just that the clackety train tracks from Kandy to Ella are home to probably the most insanely picturesque train ride in the entire world . Whether you’re sitting in the doorway of a crowded carriage with your feet dangling over the tracks, or half-falling out the window from your seat inside as you strain your neck out the window the best view; winding through misty forests, verdant tea plantations, over gushing waterfalls and streams, and past colourful towns and excitable locals will be one of the most memorable journeys of your life. Beyond the epic views, the vibe is what makes this train ride so special. Prepare to be met by some of the most genuine smiles you’ll ever encounter; groups of locals singing, playing drums, or dancing (or doing all three!), vendors rushing through with flasks full of sweet chai, and every window or doorway crammed with the heads of tourists and locals alike, all staring in amazement at the views and jostling for the best views. When we first visited Sri Lanka in 2016, the Kandy to Ella train ride was yet to really hit the big time, however, due to its current popularity, you need to book your travel in advance (usually 1 - 2 days prior). The train may also be quite crowded (especially during peak season), so be warned you may need to push your way onto the train (as long as you do this respectfully it won’t cause offence). Third class may be the cheapest option, but in our opinion, it's also the best, as it allows you to sit/hang out of the doorways, and is filled with friendly locals keen to help you enjoy your experience. Tip: the most scenic part of the journey is from Nanu Oya to Ella, through the dense forest of the Horton Plains national park, so we recommend getting the window seat or standing in between the doorways, and enjoying the views as they pass by.

The artificial lake was built in 1807 by Sri Wickrama Rajasinha , the last ruler of the kingdom of Kandy, who wanted to build a waterway to get to the other side of the valley. Things didn't quite go to plan though. The local tribes protested the labour, at which point the king ordered they be put to death on stakes. Gruesome. After its completion, the island in the middle was used for Sri Wickrama Rajasinha's personal harem. When the British eventually moved in during the early 1800s, the island became an ammunition store. The idyllic lake is the perfect place to get your bearings in Kandy, and to see some of the local wildlife - at one point, we thought we were about to be attacked by a crocodile, only to realise it was an extremely large monitor lizard! Beware their backends though, they have a mighty strong tail whip that you don’t want to be on the receiving end of. It takes about an hour to walk the lake’s circumference (just over 3kms), and our favourite part was around the area next to the Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic. THE DETAILS Where | Kandy Lake, Kandy Cost | Free #8 HIKE HANTHANA MOUNTAIN Despite its verdant surroundings and stunning lake, Kandy can feel a little overwhelming and claustrophobic at times, and the constant noise and hustle of the downtown had our eyes looking upward, towards the endless mountains that surround the city. So, we decided to escape the city to experience one of Kandy’s (and possibly the country’s) most popular day hikes. Hanthana Mountain Range is located about 30 minutes outside of town (and close to the Ceylon Tea Museum), and is a favourite among local hikers and Kandyans for its incredible panoramic views. The trail begins easy, amongst lush tea plantations that are a staple of Sri Lankan scenery. After around 30 minutes, the path ascends through more challenging terrain - we’re talking 15 minutes of large steps with towering grass on either side that increase your heart rate to the max. The views, though are incredible, and the higher you go, the better they get. Eventually, you’ll arrive at the Hanthana ridge line, which slowly snakes its way through jungle and grassy plains to the final vantage point, which offers spectacular panorama views of Kandy and Peradeniya, and Kandy in the distance on one side, and the vast, tea-covered mountains to the east on the other. We sat for a good hour enjoying the cool breeze and gorgeous views without another soul in sight - the mountain has a subtle way of making the hustle and bustle of city life seem far away. The Hanthana Mountain hike is a great option for travellers who are spending more than two nights in Kandy, but if you’re on a shorter trip around Sri Lanka, save your hiking for Ella - where Mini Adams Peak or Ella Rock hikes offer equally impressive views, with greater accessibility. … Our hike was booked through our accommodation, but you can book a tour in advance here. Alternatively, if you wish to do the hike independently, take a tuk-tuk to the Hanthana ticket office ( here ), and follow the trail to the Hanthana World End viewpoint ( here ) Overall, the hike is moderate in difficulty, but a medium level of fitness is required - the ascent was tough, especially in the heat, while the descent put a lot of strain on our weary knees (we’re getting old!). The high humidity adds another challenge. If you have hiking boots, wear them - otherwise, running shoes will suffice. Pack plenty of water (2 litres should do), some snacks, and your camera. And finally, leeches can be a problem in wet and shoulder seasons - so wear pants and use bug spray to prevent bites. THE DETAILS Where | Hanthana Mountain Range hike, Kandy Best Time to Visit | Between December - April, when the weather is relatively dry and the visibility is at its best. Start your hike early to avoid the midday heat Difficulty Level | Moderate, suitable for both novices and experienced hikers. A decent level of fitness is required Duration | 4km - 4 to 6 hours What to Bring | Wear comfortable hiking shoes, carry water, snacks, and a raincoat (the weather can be unpredictable). Don't forget your camera Tips | Remember to leave no trace, keeping the mountain as pristine and beautiful as you found it #9 EXPLORE THE MARKET STREETS OF KANDY OLD TOWN We love the hustle and bustle of local markets, especially in Sri Lanka . There's always something to see, someone to meet, or more importantly for Mim, something to eat. Located between Sri Delada Veediya Rd and Colombo St, the old town of Kandy is home to a labyrinth of market stores selling everything from textiles to incense. The loud and chaotic streets are filled with local Kandyans going about their daily business, and we found it a great plac", "images":

Whether you’re looking for hostels or hotels, boutique stays, eco-luxury, or the perfect airbnb, our guide to Ella accommodation has you absolutely covered! If you’re a traveller to Sri Lanka , there’s a 99.99% chance that you’ll find yourself in the lush hill country town of Ella (read our guide to the best things to do in Ella here !). It is, after all, one of the country’s fastest-growing and most popular tourist destinations and from towering Ella Rock to the fog-covered Nine Arch Bridge , the infamous Kandy to Ella train through the tea plantations to the roaring Diyaluma Falls , many of our most favourite Sri Lankan adventures are found right here. It also means there’s a 99.99% chance you’ll need to find a place to stay in Ella too! Luckily, accommodation here is both easily come by and as varied as its major attractions. We first visited Ella four years ago, when it was just starting to show signs of stirring from a sleepy hill country town to a thriving tourist hub. Guesthouses were the main accommodation option (and the one we opted for), with a few larger-scale hotels scattered through. On our return last year, this had all changed. Today, there are luxurious eco-hotels in the jungle canopy, hostels popping up in town, and several budget and mid-range hotels, guesthouses and Airbnbs offering the perfect pillow for any budget or travel style. In this guide, we cover everything you need to know about Ella's accommodation, plus our recommendations for everything from luxurious stays to hostel beds, essential travel tips, and what to do in Ella while you’re there. LOVE OUR PHOTOS? Edit like us with our Tropical Dreams Preset Packs , and Tropical Bliss mobile video filters, inspired by the tropical beauty and colour of this beautiful country WHERE TO STAY IN ELLA, SRI LANKA OUR TOP PICK | Chill Ville Viewpoint Hotel LUXURY | 98 Acres Resort and Spa BEST HOMESTAY | Idyll Homestay Ella MOST AFFORDABLE | Rowinrich cottages ELLA ACCOMMODATION | WHAT TO KNOW BEFORE YOU GO Before you book any accommodation in Ella, there are a few key things you should know: LOCATION IS IMPORTANT The distance between places might not look like much on a map, but you need to remember that this is hill country… which can mean surprisingly, steep and windy roads! Choosing where to stay in Ella depends a lot on what you’d like to see and do in the town and surrounds while you’re there. If you’re keen to spend more time near Little Adam’s Peak and the Nine Arch Bridge , book your accommodation further along the Ella-Passara road (the road leading up the hill from Ella town). You’ll be further from the heart of town (about 25 25-minute walk downhill — also dark at night!) but enjoy more tranquillity and easier access to these two attractions. Alternatively, if Ella Rock and the buzz of Ella town is more your vibe, opt for accommodation closer to the town centre or railway station for the most convenient location. Tuk tuks can be rented from just about anywhere too, so you can move easily between places if accessibility is an issue. BOOK YOUR ACCOMMODATION IN ADVANCE A few years ago, it was just fine to turn up in Ella without booking first, and easily find a room to stay. These days, thanks to Ella’s booming popularity we’d recommend booking at least a couple of days in advance, particularly in the busier peak seasons. On our most recent trip, we left it to the morning of our trip there and had fairly slim pickings of places to stay left! HOSTELS | Search and book hostels in Ella HOTELS | Search and book hotels in Ella ELLA’S TOURISM BOOM MEANS ACCOMMODATION MIGHT BE MORE EXPENSIVE We noticed a decent jump in accommodation prices in Ella from 2016 to our most recent, and this is due in large part to the tourism boom and rapid growth of the hospitality industry up there. In several instances, we found prices had jumped by more than 20% since our first trip there, and certainly more than we’d paid for rooms in the south — so keep this in mind when budgeting for your trip! 11 Amazing things to see and do in Ella, Sri Lanka LUXURY HOTELS IN ELLA, SRI LANKA NINE SKIES ELLA Oh, if we could live at Nine Skies forever we simply would. Combining colonial heritage with contemporary facilities, Nine Skies is perfect for travellers seeking refined luxury in Ella. Set on a working tea estate in the town of Demodara, just outside of Ella, the refurbished five-bedroom tea bungalow provides lavish bedrooms with period furnishings that open onto tea-fringed gardens. It feels a little old-English, like something you’d find nestled amongst the mountains of the Lake District. Start your day with a cup or two of the perfect brew alongside traditional Sri Lankan breakfasts (nom), followed by tours amongst the hills, hiking trips, tea-estate visits – or just unwind leisurely by the pool with that amazing view. Beyond the rooms, the estate houses a stunning infinity pool overlooking a cottage garden and endless tea fields, an exceptional on-site restaurant, and a relaxing lounge where delving deep into a book is the order of the day. If you’re looking for a taste of the quintessential Sri Lankan tea-country lifestyle, in absolute luxury, this is the best hotel to stay at in Ella.

This is a great option for those seeking eco-friendly hotels in Sri Lanka (remember our fave Sri Lankan eco-hotel, Tri Lanka ?!). Most chalets are designed using upcycled and recyclable materials; discarded railway sleepers provide foundations, while locally sourced granite and timber, Illuk straw thatched roofs, and furniture designed by local expert artisans come together to create unique and luxurious rooms that celebrate the best of Sri Lanka. The 98 Acres spa is also well worth a visit, with rooms overlooking the mountains and herbal treatments made from tea and other herbal plants grown on the 98 acre tea estate — a truly local Ella experience! The resort is only a short tuk-tuk from the Ella train station, 10-minute walk to Little Adam’s Peak, and a 15-minute walk to the Nine Arch Bridge.

Set in Ella Gap, the hotel's design harmoniously integrates with the slope (it’s built into a 60-degree slope!), providing panoramic views of the stunning mountainous landscapes Ella is so famous for. The luxurious, spacious rooms, complete with large balconies offer stunning views (seriously, they’re amazing), creating the perfect place to relax after a day exploring Ella. There’s also a stunning pool that feels like you’re swimming amongst the canopy and an on-site restaurant that blends local and international cuisine Hide Ella Hotel & Resort is the perfect retreat for those seeking luxury in the heart of Sri Lanka's scenic hill country.

Each of Chill Ville’s cabins is spacious and modern, with concrete and wood finishings that wouldn’t look out of place in a sleek beachside villa and lots of homely touches to make you feel right at home like yoga mats to enjoy some morning stretching in the sun! The restaurant and bar on site serve western and traditional Sri Lankan fare, the pool amongst the treetops is worth an afternoon or two of lazing beside — and if you're keen to get to the famous Nine Arch Bridge before the hordes of tourists descend, Chill Ville is just 800m away from Ella’s star attraction.

Country Homes’ vision is to provide a tranquil setting and personalised service to discerning travellers, and they’ve nailed it. Furnished with pine and all the necessities you could need (mini fridge, tea and coffee station, etc!) while enjoying your Ella break, rooms are spacious and super comfy. Although be warned - tearing yourself from the wide-angle view of the valley below will be a fairly hard task!

The rooms are spacious, and equipped with every amenity one could want from a mid-range hotel. Yet, the hotel’s most extraordinary feature is, undeniably, the view. It offers unobstructed vistas of the Ella Gap and Ella Rock, best enjoyed from the magnificent terrace, home to a luxurious jacuzzi. There’s also an onsite restaurant that serves Sri Lankan classics and a few Western options, best enjoyed on that terrace.

But don’t let that dissuade you from staying. Immersed in nature, and close to the Nine Arch Bridge, the location is spot on. The rooms are large, making the hotel perfect for families, while each room has a balcony with incredible views (you can even see the train pass the Nine Arch Bridge). The large outdoor pool and sun terrace have ridiculously good views, best enjoyed at sunset. Overall, Tip Top Boutique Hotel is a perfect option for families, but don’t expect 5* luxury like some of the stays in the south of the country.

The cottages are spacious loft-style, with terraces overlooking the jungle-clad valley and Ella Rock. Each cottage can fit 2-3 people comfortably, and there’s a mini fridge and kettle/tea station in each. Right next to a gorgeous pine forest, you’ll fall asleep to the sounds of the surrounding nature (while you’re safely in your comfy bed with mosquito net, of course!) and the morning sun on your terrace balcony is the stuff of every traveller's or yogis dreams! It's a perfect option for those looking for a clean, comfortable glam/backpacker stay… without having to deal with a randomly mixed dorm! The road up to Rowinrich is a little potholed, and narrow, and there isn’t much parking - so if mobility is an issue for you, that’s something to keep in mind. THE DETAILS Where | 76 Police Station Rd, Ella Cost | $ BOOK | Rowinrich Cottages As we mentioned earlier, until recently guesthouses have been the more popular and frequently-used accommodation in Sri Lanka (particularly around Ella). They tend to be the more affordable option, while staying with a local family in one of the most beautiful Hill Country regions in the world and getting to understand local life here is unbeatable. It’s generally the way we choose to travel through Ella and beyond. IDYLL HOMESTAY Idyll Homestay was one of Ella’s very first official homestay offerings, starting with a single room in owner Anil’s home rented to travellers who passed through the town. Anil once worked in the tea plantations ( very common employment for locals in Ella!) and saw it as an opportunity to create some extra cash for his family. Today, the Idyll Homestay has five rooms available to guests, and Anil and his family — well known for going out of their way to make their visitors feel right at home — have created one of the best-loved homestays in Ella. Whether it’s preparing an insanely good traditional Sri Lankan breakfast spread, or the best tips for what to see in Ella and surrounds, they’re always there to lend a hand or show travellers some genuine Sri Lankan hospitality (aka the best hospitality in the world!). Idyll Homestay also run a shuttle service into town, and you can hire bikes from the family too.

Ella town is just 10 minute’s walk away (follow the train tracks back into town), or 5 minutes by tuk-tuk. Nine Arch Bridge is a 10-15 minute walk away, and Ella Rock is just 1.5km away.

There are plenty of hang-out spaces to immerse yourself in the peace of your surroundings. Host Ishaanke is always around with a friendly smile and a great recommendation for sightseeing in Ella, and his tasty breakfast and delicious traditional Sri Lankan feasts are not to be missed!

For the most part, accommodation has tended to be hotels, or Airbnb / guesthouse style stays — but over the last three years of our travels through the country, we’ve noticed that this all seems to be changing. Several popular hostels have popped up now across the country, Ella included. You can search for the best hostels in Ella on Hostelworld , and we’ve outlined our top recommendations (i.e. the ones we’d stay in ourselves!) below: BUNK STATION HOSTEL Bunk Station Hostel is a relative newcomer to the hostel scene in Ella (they opened in February 2019), and it’s made its mark in that time. Now one of the most popular hostels in Ella, Bunk Station is the perfect place for travellers looking for a peaceful, friendly, and laid-back atmosphere along with brand spankin’ new, clean facilities. There are four 8-10 bed dorms, both mixed and female-only, 24-hour hot water, plenty of cosy common areas to hang out with new friends in, and a kitchen to cook in if you’d like too. Breakfast, free tea and coffee is also provided, as well as board games and free wi-fi. Bunk Station Hostel is well situated in between all the key highlights, while Ella town is just a 10-minute walk away.

Plan your safari adventure with our detailed overview of the park, including the park's history, wildlife, where to stay and the best time to visit. Start planning your safari adventure now! Seeing an elephant for the first time is overwhelming. They’re majestic creatures, especially in their natural habitat. Their habits are human-like, as is their connection to family. The ways they communicate in grunts and trumpets, protect their young, feed and fend, all bear a striking resemblance to humans. It’s their sheer size, however, that is most striking. They’re huge - and even larger than expected in 3D. In Udawalawe National Park, elephants are everywhere. They roam in herds of up to 30 and total up to 600 in the park, which means a visit here is almost guarantee of sightings. There are also leopards, crocodiles, water buffalo, deer, and all types of bird species, but it’s the elephant that’s the star of the show here. Seeing them roam the plains, dust themselves, tend to their young, eat and drink, and simply be wild elephants, is a core memory from Sri Lanka we’ll never forget. And that’s what makes a safari in Udawalawe , and indeed Sri Lanka, so damn exciting. Just a four-hour drive from the capital, Colombo, and close by the famed southern coast and central highlands, the national park is reminiscent of those far more popular in Africa or India, yet so much more accessible. In our opinion, this is the best place to witness elephants in their natural habitat just about anywhere in the world, and for that reason, we think it’s a must-see on any Sri Lanka itinerary . We’ve put together this guide to help you experience a safari in Udawalawe for yourself. With detailed information on how to get there, where to stay, and the costs and fees associated, this is the only guide you need to read. Enjoy, and remember to bring your camera - you won’t regret it. LOVE OUR PHOTOS?

Primarily created to provide a sanctuary for the large population of wild elephants that lived in the area, as well as to protect the diverse range of flora and fauna found in the park, Udawalawe also provides a catchment area for the Udawalawe Reservoir, which is an important source of water for the surrounding area. Known for its amazing wildlife (read: elephants, and plenty of them!) and breathtaking landscapes, he park is nestled in the district of Uva, part of the Udawalawe reservoir, the largest water body in the dry zone of Sri Lanka , and covers an area of around 31,000 hectares. UDAWALAWE NATIONAL PARK SAFARI | WHAT TO EXPECT Our morning safari started early (book yours here ), as all good ones do. The air was heavy and sweaty, and a dense mist sat just above the ground, providing an eerie, yet astoundingly beautiful journey towards the park’s entry gates. The skies turned to fire as we waited in silence, with many other jeeps, for the gates to open. As the sun began to emerge above the horizon, the jeep shook into gear, and off we went, through the towering gates, into the park. The dirt road was bumpy, the surrounding environment relatively barren - a smattering of grassland and mid-sized trees dotted the landscape. It wasn’t long before we stumbled across our first animal, a painted stork, sitting prominently on the top of a dead tree. Now, a stork isn’t exactly exotic, but the keen twitcher who formed part of our safari group was wildly excited by this initial discovery. It made us keenly await a sighting of what we’d come to see, an elephant. Before long we’d made our way further into the park when our guide slammed on the breaks. To our right was a family of about six elephants, strolling majestically through the dense, low-hanging foliage that we’d recently entered. There, we watched in silence as this family went about their morning routines - one rubbing their back on a tree, the other spraying dirt over themselves to protect against the oppressive heat. “There’s a baby”, Mim excitedly squealed, holding back tears that seem to overwhelm her at any major animal encounter. We watched this baby slowly emerge from beneath its mother’s torso and watched intensely as the cute baby played and explore amongst the family and surrounding trees. It was the highlight of our day, already. After a good 10 minutes, we continued further into the park, stopping at various waterholes to observe a range of impish crocodiles sunning their bodies, mouths open as if willing a bird, deer, or would-be tourist, to touch their tongue. Over the next 2 hours, we spotted a diverse range of the park’s birds and mammals - water buffalo, deer, colourful peacocks, eagles and, wonderfully, more elephants. The midpoint of the tour coincided with a stop at one of the vast reservoirs - we enjoyed tea and biscuits, overlooking the water, pondering how a country so small could have such a vast array of wildlife. It was at this point our guide, Lasith, gave us a more thorough rundown of the flora and fauna within the park. After 30 minutes, we set off again, our jeep chugging through the barren landscapes before we stumbled across the most magnificent sight, a majestic bull elephant wading in one of the small watering holes. We watched in awe, mesmerised by the sheer presence of these special animals. And that was that a four-hour safari done, a myriad of wonderful animal sitings, and of course, an overwhelming amount of elephants witnessed. While we were slightly disappointed not to see the famed Leopards that stroll the island’s national parks, we were comfortable in the knowledge that sitings here are rare, and that it is far more likely to see one at Yala National Park . Overall, on most Udawalawe National Park safaris you can expect to see a wide variety of wildlife in their natural habitat. If you are a bird lover or prefer any other animal, mention this to your guide beforehand so he can take you to the best spots. Otherwise, the whole safari might be the rush between one elephant herd and the other, which again, isn’t the worst thing, as our experience shows. During your Udawalawe safari, it’s likely you’ll get up close and personal with many elephants - they’re in abundance in the park, and are very accustomed to the jeeps, unlike in places like the Serengeti or Chobe National Park. Just remember to ask your driver to switch off the engine while observing the wildlife in front of you. The safari jeeps themselves are an exciting and adventurous way to explore the park, especially if you’ve never been on a safari. They have large open sides, and lots of room to move around and take photos. Regardless of where you sit, you will have a good view of the surrounding scenery and wildlife. Just don’t ever exit the vehicle unless otherwise told (for safety reasons!). The ride itself is bumpy and rough but it’s all part of the fun, and all the excitement after seeing your first elephant will make you hardly notice it after a while. On top of that, the landscape you will pass by is stunning. From savannah-like grasslands to dense forests and wetlands, it’s typically Sri Lankan in nature. Once inside the park, you’ll have to pay the park entrance fee at the ticket office. If you have booked a tour and paid in advance, the driver will get tickets for everyone. After entering the park, all the jeeps will thankfully spread out and take different routes to avoid overcrowding and scaring animals away. WHAT ANIMALS WILL YOU SEE IN UDAWALAWE NATIONAL PARK Some of the most majestic animals in the world call Udawalawe National Park home. Expect to see elephants and many of them. Roaming freely around in large herds, elephants are Udawalawe's key attraction, making this park a perfect place to get up close and personal with these gentle giants. Alongside numerous elephant herds, Udawalawe National Park gives you an opportunity to spot other mammals such as deers, sloth bears, leopards, monkeys, water buffaloes, crocodiles, and jackals - it feels like you're on the set of a National Geographic documentary, just without the commentary from Attenborough (unfortunately!). The leopards that roam the park are particularly elusive animals, so keep your eyes peeled and your camera ready if you're lucky enough to spot one - as we said, we didn’t here, but thankfully managed to in Yala National Park . If you’re a bird lover, you’ll be happy to know that Udawalawe National Park is home to over 150 species of birds, so if you’re looking forward to seeing some of Sri Lanka’s most exotic birds, be sure to bring your binoculars. Finally, don't forget to keep an eye out for crocodiles basking on the banks of the Udawalawe Reservoir, and water monitors lazing in the sun. HOW MANY ELEPHANTS ARE IN UDAWALAWE NATIONAL PARK The number of elephants in Udawalawe National Park can vary depending on the time of the year and the dynamics of the herd. According to recent estimates, the park currently has around 600 wild elephants, making it home to one of the largest and most stable elephant populations in Sri Lanka . Although it's very likely you'll be able to spot them wandering around, please note this cannot be guaranteed as wild animals are unpredictable. THINGS TO KNOW BEFORE VISITING UDAWALAWE NATIONAL PARK DO YOU NEED A GUIDE TO VISIT UDAWALAWE NATIONAL PARK? Our guide, a legendary Sri Lankan man with an eagle eye and a wealth of knowledge about the park and its inhabitants, made our experience at Udawalawe National Park exceptional, so if you are wondering whether or not you need a guide to explore the park, the answer is a resounding YES! Guides are there to help you make the most of your visit. These guys have spent their lives learning about the park, its animals, and conservation efforts, which means they can point out animals and plants that you might otherwise miss, but also share interesting facts about wildlife behaviours. Also, they will know the best routes throughout the park and have the inside scoop on the best times of day to visit certain areas. Additionally, having a guide with you is much safer. As wild animals are unpredictable, especially the elephants within the park, so it is always a good idea to have someone with you who knows how to navigate the area safely and is introduced to the park's rules and regulations. This way, you will avoid any potential mistakes that could put you or the animals at risk. Another perk of hiring Udawalawe National Park guide is that they are in constant communication with other safari drivers. If an animal is roaming on the other side of the park, your guide will have the information on time and can take you to the spot immediately. Lastly, exploring Udawalawe National Park safari with a guide makes a really affordable option to experience the park in its full glory. BOOK | Udawalawe Safari + Guide WHEN IS THE BEST TIME TO VISIT UDAWALAWE NATIONAL PARK As we explain in our ‘39 things to know before visiting Sri Lanka’ post, the Island experiences not just one, but two monsoon periods each year, affecting opposite sides of the island and alternate times of the year. The dry season, which runs from December through March, really is really the only time to visit Udawalawe National Park, as the lack of water means plenty of wildlife to be seen around reservoirs. We visited in April, and while it was a great time to see the elephants, it was overwhelmingly hot and sweaty, making the experience less than comfortable. It’s worth noting the main southwest monsoon, ‘Yala’, brings heavy wind and intense rains to the west and southwest coastlines, including Udawalawe National Park from April/May through to August. The second monsoon hits the east coast and northern regions (Trincomalee, Arugam Bay, Nilaveli, Jaffna ) between October and February. During the monsoon season (May to October), the park is at its most lush and green, but heavy rains and flooded roads could spoil the mood, plus it may be difficult to spot animals due to the weather. It’s for this reason, we’d steer well clear of the park, and Sri Lanka in general. Regardless of the season you choose, be sure to book a safari early in the morning or late in the afternoon as the animals are most active during this time of the day.

There are several ways to reach the park: by car, taxi or public transport. Travelling by bus is a common and cost-effective option, especially if you're travelling on a budget, plus it is a cool opportunity to mingle with locals - although we decided to catch a tuk-tuk from Ella to save time. FROM THE SOUTHERN COAST (MIRISSA, HIRIKETIYA) TO UDAWALAWA Bus journey | Mirissa – Matara – Udawalawa Cost |Around 1,10 euros Travel time | Around 3.5 hours FROM ELLA TO UDAWALAWA Bus journey | Ella – Udawalawa Cost | 1,30 euros Travel time | Around 5.30 hours FROM COLOMBO TO UDAWALAWA Bus journey | Colombo - Udawalawa Cost | 0,80 euros Travel time | Between 5 and 6 hours UDAWALAWE NATIONAL PARK SAFARI COST As with most things in Sri Lanka , visiting Udawalawe National Park can be done without breaking the bank, especially when compared to African safaris. Before visiting, you do need to know that there are generally two fees that need to be paid when taking a safari. PARK ENTRY FEES First, there are the park entry fees. These vary depending on whether you're a local or a foreign visitor, but they generally range from around $25 USD per adult during peak season, or $20 USD in the off-season, or equivalent in Sri Lankan rupees (this gives you access to the park for the day). SAFARI FEES Next, there are the Udawalawe National Park safari fees. These are the fees you pay to rent a jeep with a driver. You can book online in advance or show up at the park and negotiate the price there. The cost can vary depending on the length of the safari and the company you choose, but you can expect to pay around $25 - $35 per person for a half-day, or $45 - $65 for a full-day safari. Now, here's a little tip that could save you some money. Always try to haggle for a more affordable rate. Even if they say it’s a fixed price, it doesn’t hurt to try. Tipping the guide is optional but we always encourage doing so if you have had an excellent experience. To ensure a seamless experience, and to avoid haggling, we suggest booking your safari prior to arrival - this highly rated tour is our recommendation, which includes hotel pick up/drop off, and an experienced guide to show you the best of the park. If you arranged with your accommodation or safari operator to include both fees in one, that’s great. If not, remember to take cash with you to enter the park. BOOK | Udawalawe Safari + Guide UDAWALAWE NATIONAL PARK OPENING TIMES Udawalawe National Park is open year-round, with opening hours from 6 am to 6 pm. HOW LONG SHOULD YOU SPEND IN UDAWALAWE NATIONAL PARK? How long you spend at Udawalawe National Park really depends on how long your Sri Lankan itinerary is. Udawalawe National Park safari can be done in just one day, which is actually what we did, but to truly immerse yourself in this wonderful experience, we recommend staying for two days. You will have more chances of seeing the park's incredible wildlife in different habitats and at different times of the day. The morning Udawalawe safari and the one in the afternoon are completely different but we are sure both will blow your mind! In case you have only one day at your disposal, you can always hop on an early morning safari and set off to your next destination afterwards. IS UDAWALAWE NATIONAL PARK WORTH VISITING? Udawalawe National Park is worth every second of your time, trust us. The abundance of elephants at every corner makes these majestic creatures the stars of the park and a sight to behold, whether you're watching a herd of adults grazing on the savannah or seeing a baby elephant playing in the mud. Udawalawe National Park is also close to many other major Sri Lanka attractions , so you don’t have to travel too far to experience the wild nature of the park. It is easily accessible by road from nearby towns but still far enough to avoid the hustle and bustle of the city. Plus, this place feels more remote and untamed than other national parks in Sri Lanka. It has a vibe of an African safari, but with the added bonus of being closer to home. Oh, and it’s super affordable when compared to other safari hotspots around the globe. One thing to note though - it gets busy - like super busy, especially in the peak holiday periods, including Sinhalese New Year. With this in mind, if you’re after a more relaxed wildlife experience, there are better national parks in Sri Lanka to visit. But overall, it’s 100% worth visiting. THINGS TO KNOW BEFORE VISITING UDAWALAWE NATIONAL PARK Before starting your Udawalawe National Park safari adventure, there are a number of important things to know, to have the most enjoyable, safe experience possible. First of all, you'll need to get up really early! The park is open from 6:00 and as we mentioned before, the best time to see the animals is early in the morning when they are most active. So, set your alarm, grab a cup of coffee and prepare to see an incredible wildlife show. Even though the days can be hot and humid, the early morning safaris can be quite cold. So, make sure to pack a warm jacket or a sweater to keep you comfortable. We also suggest taking sunscreen and insect repellent as the sun can be quite intense and the bugs can be quite pesky, so you'll want to protect yourself. Don't forget to bring some snacks and water to stay hydrated and energized. Most of the Udawalawe safari tours will provide tea and snacks on board but it's always a good idea to have a backup, especially if you get hangry like Mim. Be aware that Udawalawe National Park can be very busy, especially during peak season. Besides that, the drivers can be a little pushy and competitive, so patience is the key here. Last but not least, don't leave home without a telephoto zoom lens. The park offers an abundance of wildlife, making it a photographer's paradise and a telephoto zoom lens will allow you to get close-up shots of the animals without disturbing them. And of course, bring your sense of adventure and curiosity! Udawalawe National Park is a truly unique and magical place, and with a little preparation and the right gear, you will have an unforgettable safari experience.

Home to a diverse array of flora and fauna, including many endangered species such as elephants, leopards, and a variety of bird species, the area was declared a national park in 1938. In the 1970s and 1980s, the park was adversely affected by poaching and the illegal trade of wildlife, but thankfully, conservation efforts by the Sri Lankan government and various non-governmental organizations helped to protect and restore the park's ecosystem. The 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami has had an adverse effect on the national park, severely altering the natural characteristics of the park, with many humans being swept away. Thankfully, the park has recovered from this terrible tragedy to become one of the most popular and accessible destinations in Sri Lanka , and the world, for those seeking to see elephants and leopards up close. The park is divided into five different zones, each with its own unique characteristics and wildlife. The most popular zones are 1 and 5, which are known for their high concentration of wildlife, especially leopards. You can enter the park through various gates, but the most popular one is the Palatupana entrance. This gate is located near the town of Tissamaharama and is the easiest to access by public transportation. Not only is Yala National Park an incredible place to see wild animals but it's also rich in cultural history with well-preserved ancient temples, including Sithulpahuwa and Magul Vihara, situated within the park. Pretty damn cool if you ask us. YALA NATIONAL PARK SAFARI | WHAT TO EXPECT Our Yala national park safari started the moment we stepped off the bus in Tissamaharama. Confronted with around 10 safari jeeps and 20+ guides searching for our business, it felt like the Sri Lankan version of the wild west. After a quick lunch, we randomly started a conversation with some local guys who hooked us up with a safari. They were young, cool and seemed like a lot of fun - not exactly the prerequisite for a brilliant safari, but we booked with them anyway and arranged a pick up for 4 am the next day. The alarm felt like a slap in the face, especially considering we were staying the gorgeous Back of Beyond camp just outside the park, and our bed was delightfully comfortable. We quickly got ready, met our effusive guides, and set off in the pitch dark, bound for the park gates. Joining a long cue of many other jeeps, we managed a short nap before the heavy diesel engine shook into gear and we made our way through the Zone #1 gates for our safari. The first thing we noticed was the flora - it felt like the plains of Africa - flat, with spindly trees and scattered grassland as far as the eye could see. The air was humid, and the cloud cover was low and grey as far as the eye can see - one of the negatives of visiting during the NE monsoon season. Alas, it was beautifully green. We drove deep into the park, following the ochre-coloured road with great anticipation. Our first animal sightings were not exactly what we can see, but wonderful nonetheless - a range of migratory birds, water buffalo, and spotted dear. Or, in other words, leopard fodder. Then we got word of a leopard spotting. Our driver and guide made a quick dash east to see if we could spot it ourselves. And sure enough, in the far distance, a majestic leopard sat atop a rock, enjoying a nap as we wished to. Despite the distance, we observed the animal for a good 30 minutes, bursting with excitement with every movement. Before long, it started to move deeper into the forest, no doubt spooked by the very many jeeps that arrived and jostled for position over the preceding 20 minutes (this is the one downside of Yala, as we explain in further detail below). Escape the crush, we set off on our own - this time in search of elephants. We drove the windy, dirt roads, encountering more buffalo, crocodiles and other small fauna before we stumbled across an elephant family at a large watering hole. Despite having seen elephants a lot in our travels, seeing these alien-like behemoths again is always an exciting experience. Engine off, we could hear each form of communication - the grunts and huffs and trumpets, and it was utterly wonderful. As the only jeep around, we observed the family for a good 15 minutes, our guides teaching us all about elephant behaviour before other jeeps arrived. This encounter was our last for a while, as we drove to Patanangala Beach picnic area for a break and walk on the beach. It was here the raw and rugged nature of the park really came to life - the heavy sea, and the vast rocky outcrops intersecting with the vast national park. It was an exceptionally beautiful place. After the stop, we encountered a further few elephants, but no more leopard sightings, before making our way outside of the park, content, yet yearning for more. Overall, the safari was a wonderful experience, and our disappointment in not seeing a leopard up close was somewhat limited by the incredible elephant encounter. Now, all safari experiences will be different, so remember to lower your expectations and don’t expect to see leopards and elephants. The most popular zones are 1 and 5 due to the incredible flora and fauna, and the highest chance of spotting animals, so we suggest making sure your safari is within one of these two zones when booking (don’t worry, most are). THINGS TO KNOW BEFORE VISITING YALA NATIONAL PARK DO YOU NEED A GUIDE TO VISIT YALA NATIONAL PARK? One of the most common questions we get asked is whether to hire a Yala National Park guide or not. And our answer is always a yes! Having a guide with you means you will have better chances of seeing the incredible animals that call the park home (book your guided tour of Yala here ). Think of your Yala National Park guide as a personal key that unlocks the secrets of the park. Not only will they know the best routes to take and prime spots to visit but they’ll also be able to point out animals and plants that you might miss on your own. And you’ll miss a LOT. These guys are well-versed around the park and can take you to the most scenic and animal-rich areas, as well as give you an exclusive glimpse into the park’s wild world. They’re also in constant communication with other safari drivers, which means you are more likely to hear about animal sightings happening in other parts of the park, especially leopards. Furthermore, having an experienced and knowledgeable guide is a small investment that can make your visit to Yala National Park, even more, fun and interesting. BOOK | This highly-rated golden hour guided safari , or this full day safari with lunch WHAT ANIMALS WILL YOU SEE ON A YALA NATIONAL PARK SAFARI The real star of the show is the leopard. With a high chance of sightings, Yala National Park is one of the best places in the world to see these majestic animals in their natural habitat. They can be a bit more elusive, but with a little patience and a sharp eye, you will be able to spot one or two. Gracefully roaming around the park, elephants are another sight to behold making Yala National Park safari a great way to get up close and personal with these gentle giants. Keep your camera ready because there are many other animals to be seen: playful monkeys crashing through the trees, timid deer hiding in the bushes, and huge crocodiles basking on the banks of rivers. Bird lovers among you will be thrilled to know that Yala National Park is home to more than 200 bird species. From the colourful peacocks to the fierce eagles, there are plenty of opportunities for bird watching during your visit. With so much wildlife to be discovered, don’t forget to bring your binoculars and telephoto zoom lens. WHERE IS YALA NATIONAL PARK, AND HOW TO GET TO THERE Located in the southeast region of Sri Lanka, between the powerful Indian Ocean on one side and luscious jungles on the other side, Yala National Park is a must-see for anyone visiting Sri Lanka . There are different ways to reach the park, depending on from which city you are starting the journey. However, the bus journey is still the most budget-friendly option, connecting the nearby cities with Tissamaharama town quite well. FROM THE SOUTHERN COAST (MIRISSA, HIRIKETIYA) TO TISSAMAHARAMA Bus journey | Mirissa – Matara – Tissamaharama Cost | Around 0,83 euros (330 LKR) Travel time | Around 3.5 hours FROM ELLA TO TISSAMAHARAMA Bus journey | Ella – Tissamaharama Cost | Around 0,55 euros (218 LKR) Travel time | Around 2.5 hours WHEN IS THE BEST TIME TO VISIT YALA NATIONAL PARK As we explain in our ‘39 things to know before visiting Sri Lanka ’ post, the Island experiences not just one, but two monsoon periods each year, affecting opposite sides of the island and alternate times of the year. The dry season, which runs from February and July, really is the only time to visit Yala National Park, as the lack of water means plenty of wildlife to be seen around reservoirs. We visited in November, just as the park was reopened, and while it was abundantly green from the northeastern monsoon, we would suggest going on a Yala National Park safari during the dry season, between February and July, when the wildlife viewing possibilities are better due to the relative lack of water. Keen to see a leopard? Between April and July, the water levels are low, which means the leopards are more active and more visible. That being said, we saw one during our visit in November. Bird watchers might prefer a period from November to January when numerous migratory birds can be seen. Finally, the park can be quite crowded (and we mean crowwwwwded!) between December and April, so if you’d like to have a more peaceful Yala National Park safari experience, consider visiting during the off-peak months. Regardless of the season you choose, be sure to book a safari early in the morning or late in the afternoon as the animals are most active during this time of the day. NOTE | The park is closed for a month from September to October for the annual maintenance/drought prevention YALA NATIONAL PARK SAFARI COST From jeep rentals to guide fees, there are several costs to consider when planning your Yala National Park safari trip. First, there are jeep safari fees that can be pre-booked online and vary depending on the zones you're visiting. On average, you will pay 42 euros for a half-day tour and 69 euros for a full-day tour in zone 1. These prices are per jeep with a maximum of 6 people, so if you want to save some money, join a larger group. Also, haggling is a must, just like in the rest of the country. It doesn’t hurt to try and you can get a much more affordable rate. Additionally, you’ll need to buy entry tickets at the gate (expect to pay around 10 euros per person). Finally, we suggest booking your Yala National Park safari before arriving at the park, so you know the quality of the operator and guides. You can book this popular Yala safari here . Alternatively, safari tours can easily be organised through your accommodation so don’t hesitate to ask your hotel staff for help. FULL DAY | Around 69 euros (27,000 - 28,000 LKR) MORNING | 6 am – 10 am, around 42 euros (16,000 – 17,000 LKR) AFTERNOON | 2 pm – 6 pm, around 42 euros (16,000-17,000 LKR) You can enter the park through various gates, but the most popular one is the Palatupana entrance. This gate is located near the town of Tissamaharama and is the easiest to access by public transportation. BOOK | This highly-rated golden hour guided safari , or this full day safari with lunch NOTE | The park usually closes every September for maintenance HOW LONG SHOULD YOU SPEND IN YALA NATIONAL PARK? It is certainly possible to see a lot in just one day. A morning or an afternoon safari can give you a good taste of what the Yala National Park has to offer. But if you're looking for the ultimate park experience, plan to stay at least 1 night/two days. Trust us, two days in this natural wonderland is just enough to fully immerse yourself in all the sights and sounds the park has to offer. Plus, you will have more time to explore the park's different habitats, which increases your chances of seeing a variety of animals. IS YALA NATIONAL PARK WORTH VISITING? If you want to see elephants and leopards in their natural habitat, with little fuss (or an expensive trip to Africa), then Yala National Park is an essential place to visit in Sri Lanka (as is Udawalawe National Park ). It boasts some of the most stunning scenery in Sri Lanka. Lush green forests in combination with wild seas, sparkling lakes and rivers are a real visual feast. Add an abundance of animals, including leopards (this is the best place to see them in their natural habitat!), elephants, crocodiles, and an impressive variety of birds, and you have The Jungle Book brought to real life. Being set in a unique position on the coast, Yala National Park offers a one-of-a-kind experience that you won't find anywhere else. Imagine sleeping under the stars and waking up to the sounds of the wild while the sun rises over the park. Sounds surreal, right? Well, in Yala National Park these dreams do come true! All the high-end accommodation is a perfect blend of nature and modern comfort with a touch of luxury. Opt for deluxe tents or elegant bungalows, and experience the park in style. Most importantly, getting to the park is relatively easy, with several transportation options from different parts of Sri Lanka . THINGS TO KNOW BEFORE VISITING YALA NATIONAL PARK As one of the most stunning and diverse wildlife reserves in the world, Yala National Park can be quite a busy place and sometimes uncomfortable so, especially during peak season, so try to visit during the shoulder seasons to avoid the crush. Photographers, make sure to pack a telephoto zoom lens. The park is home to an incredible diversity of wildlife that you'll want to be able to capture in all its glory. With a telephoto zoom lens, you can get up close and personal with the animals without disturbing them. If you're joining a morning safari, be ready to hit the road early. The park opens at 6 am and you'll want to get in first so set your alarm on time! Also, morning safaris can be quite chilly so bring a jacket or a sweater. Pack some snacks and water. It's always a good idea to have something to munch on while you're out exploring. Keep in mind that there are no toilets in the park so don’t over-hydrate.

Our best hotels in Galle guide, features the best luxury hotels, mid-range and boutique hotels, and homestays in this coastal gem. Galle Fort is unlike any other place we’ve found in Sri Lanka ; an atmospheric ancient fort town plonked in the deliciously salty tropics. It’s a melting pot of culture and religion bursting with colour, and where, thankfully, the taste of Ceylon tea and cinnamon is never far away. Home to an ancient spice-trading history, it was colonised thrice by the Portuguese, Dutch, and British, their influences still vividly present throughout Galle Fort, which was initially constructed by the Portuguese and was later conquered by the Dutch. Declared a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1988 for its extensive fortifications, the Dutch colonial-era architecture and history is also present in many hotels in the area. As a result, Galle is blessed with some of the most beautiful, charming and unique accommodation options in Sri Lanka, ranging from meticulously restored luxury heritage hotels to budget hotels and homestays that provide the best of Sri Lanka hospitality. As a result, choosing where to stay in Galle can be a tough ask. That’s where this guide comes in handy. We’ve reviewed some of the best hotels, boutique hotels, and homestays in the city to help you find suitable accommodation based on budgets and travel styles (if you’re also travelling to Ella , read our accommodation guide here ). In short, our curated guide on the best hotels in Galle is everything you need to book the accommodation of your dreams, in the coastal city of dreams. WHERE TO STAY IN GALLE OUR TOP PICK | The Fort Printers BEST VALUE | Mango House BOUTIQUE BEAUTY | Thambili House by Edwards Collection MOST AFFORDABLE | Southern Comforts, Galle Fort GALLE FORT HOTELS | WHAT TO KNOW WHERE IS GALLE FORT? Beautiful Galle Fort is located in the city of Galle in the southwest corner of Sri Lanka , around 110km from the capital, Colombo, and just a short drive to some of Sri Lanka’s popular beachside enclaves, including Hikkaduwa, Unawatuna , and Mirissa. Situated on a rocky peninsula, the sea surrounds Galle Fort from three sides, making it a wonderful location for a Fort. HOW LONG DO YOU NEED IN GALLE FORT? Alluring, exotic, and totally loveable, Galle Fort is one of the unmissable points of interest on your Sri Lankan itinerary , and a place we could spend a week in if given the chance. We’d recommend staying at least 2 - 3 nights in Galle Fort to get a good feel of the historic area and the daily life which still operates within it, before moving onto the southern beaches including Unawatuna – although however long you stay, you’ll have no trouble enjoying all the wonderful places to visit in Galle . READ | Our complete guide to Galle Fort STAYING IN GALLE FORT VS GALLE CITY Before booking your Galle hotel, we recommend checking whether it’s based within the Fort walls, or within Galle city. Hotels based within the Galle Fort are close to all the major Galle Fort attractions, including the Lighthouse, rampart, and Pedlar St. shops, as well as the myriad of exceptional restaurants. Also, hotels in this area are likely to be housed within former historic mansions, providing an alluring stay. Hotels based outside the Fort are likely to be more recently built hotels, or local homestays, and provide a different Galle experience altogether. It feels a little more local outside the Fort walls - life beats to a different drum, and you’re not stuck in the Galle Fort tourist cocoon, which means experiences might be a little more authentic, especially at local markets and restaurants (the best meal we had in Sri Lanka was in Galle City!). Although not having the beauty of Galle Fort within a short walk is a big downside, so be prepared to take a tuk-tuk, or an organised tour. It’s, for this reason, we suggest staying within Galle Fort . BEST LUXURY HOTELS IN GALLE THE FORT BAZAAR The Fort Bazaar is one of the best hotels in Galle Fort that boasts the essence of a 17th-century townhouse. Situated within the well-preserved Galle Fort, this exquisite space was once the home of a merchant, and now it has been redesigned into a boutique hotel with stylish and spacious guest rooms, the interiors in particular evoke a wonderful Middle Eastern vibe.

Anytime from October - April is a good time to visit Galle, as the monsoon rains have passed and the temperatures are fairly stable. That being said, the absolute BEST time to visit is between February - April , when low rainfall and calmer seas provide the perfect weather to explore. We’ve been told to avoid visiting during early January when Sri Lankan holidays occur and Galle is teeming with local tourists. HOW TO GET TO GALLE FORT TRAIN The most scenic way to get from Colombo to Galle is via train, which runs along the palm-fringed coast the majority of the journey. The Colombo Fort to Galle train departs 10 times a day, with the earliest departure at 6:55 am and the final departure at 19:30. It takes around 2.5 - 3.5 hours. We recommend travelling outside of peak hours to avoid packed trains and an uncomfortable journey (we’ve taken the 10:30 am train many times without issue). THE DETAILS Cost | 180 LKR per person for 2nd class, 100 LKR per person for 3rd class Departure Times | From Colombo Fort only: 0655, 0835, 1030, 1425, 1550, 1646, 1730, 1735, 1805, 1930 BUS If you prefer your creature comforts (air-conditioning), there’s a direct bus from Maharagama bus station (in the suburbs of Colombo) to Galle, which follows the newly completed inland highway. You’re guaranteed a seat, and the air-conditioning is a welcome relief in Sri Lanka. THE DETAILS Cost | 360 LKR - 400 LKR per person Departure Times | Every 20 minutes from 5am - 16:45pm If you’re on a very tight budget, it’s also possible to take the local bus from Colombo to Galle, however, we don’t recommend this option due to the exceedingly long and tedious journey. The local bus will leave from Colombo Fort bus station, and cost 100 LKR per person. SRI LANKA BACKPACKING ESSENTIALS Travelling through Sri Lanka comes with a unique set of needs.

Explore the this quintessential beachside town and where to stay, eat, and drink, plus the best time to visit. When it comes to tourism on Sri Lanka ’s southern coast, Mirissa has long been the poster child. A quintessential beachside town set up for backpackers, Mirissa’s expansive golden sand beach with wonderful surf (and a whale migration!), close proximity to Colombo, Galle , Udawalawe and Ella , and cheap accommodation and food, led to Mirissa attracting the masses, and by early 2020, it was Sri Lanka’s most popular southern town. When we first visited in 2016, it still felt sleepy; beachside shacks served the day’s best catch, accommodation was mostly guesthouses run by wonderfully friendly locals, jungle still filled the hills and peninsula in which Mirissa sits, and the majority of restaurants were serving rice and curry. A global pandemic, a proxy war in Europe, and mass migration of nationals have led to an altogether different experience in Mirissa. This is why, after returning in early 2023, Mirissa was no longer the sleepy, backpacker hub on the southern coast ( Hiriketiya and Ahangama Beach are those, now). Development has exploded. High-rise hotels and apartment complexes dot the skyline. Trendy cafes line the streets and backstreets. And the laidback feel of town has gone. Now, this is not to say Mirissa is worse than before. It’s actually still enjoyable. It’s just different. You can still spend your days lazing by the beach, enjoying a beachside seafood feast. You can still watch the best sunset you’ll ever see. You can still learn to surf, see whales, or devour rice and curry. But just expect to do so in a little less authentic environment. Now, don’t let this put you off visiting Mirissa. It’s still an essential stop on any Sri Lankan itinerary and can form the perfect base for south coast explorations. This guide aims to showcase the very best things to do in Mirissa, plus where to eat and sleep, and the best time to visit. Oh, and transport tips to help you get there. LOVE OUR PHOTOS?

THE BEACH HOUSE BY REVEAL The Beach House by Reveal in Mirissa is an intimate haven blending luxury with the soothing rhythm of the ocean. The elegantly designed suites offer unobstructed ocean vistas, inviting you to wake up to breathtaking sunrises and sunset cocktails. The beachside pool is stunning, while the gourmet cuisine celebrates local flavours. All in all, this is the luxury haven you’re looking for. BOOK | The Beach House Mirissa THE SLOW VEGAN HOTEL Enjoy understated, mindful luxury at The Slow Vegan Hotel in Mirissa. A haven for conscious travellers, this boutique gem combines sustainable living with thoughtfully curated spaces reflecting a blend of eco-chic aesthetics and coastal minimalism. You can also indulge in their incredible plant-based restaurant, while also enjoying yoga sessions on the sun-kissed deck. BOOK | The Slow Vegan Hotel BANANA BUNKS MIRISSA Banana Bunks Mirissa personifies a carefree island. A vibrant hub nestled in the heart of Mirissa, this hostel exudes a bohemian charm that captures the spirit of Sri Lanka's coastal vibe. From cozy dormitories to breezy private rooms, Banana Bunks offers an affordable haven for every wanderer. BOOK | Banana Bunks Mirissa WHAT TO SEE AND DO IN MIRISSA CHILL OUT ON MIRISSA BEACH Mirissa Beach may not be the best beach in Sri Lanka , but it’s certainly right up there, an idyllic south-coast haven that beckons with its sun-kissed shores, towering palms, and azure waters. A typical day here is spent enjoying the rhythmic crashing of waves as you lounge beneath the sun on the endless golden sands. As the sun sets, a breathtaking palette of colours paints the sky, the perfect backdrop as you down yet another tropical cocktail at a chic beachside bar. The small western cove is a haven for surfers, who enjoy its long barrels and shallow waters - and while Mirissa isn’t the best place to learn to surf (nearby Weligama is the place!), you can still learn to surf here. The rest of the beach though, is perfect for lounging, swimming and doing little else. You can camp out under the shade of an umbrella (at a cost), or head down towards Parrot Rock to lounge under the shade of towering palms. Lining the shore are beachside eateries and bars serving up the best of Sri Lankan and Western foods (W&D Beach Restaurant is the pick of the bunch - get there Yellow Fin Tuna), however, it’s the seafood that’s the star of the show here (there’s a nearby fisheries harbour, so you can guarantee the seafood here is fresh!). Our evening spent on the shore, enjoying a seafood feast, remains one of our most memorable in Sri Lanka - there’s just something about enjoying a candlelit meal on the beach that sticks deep in the memory bank. Overall though, a trip to Mirissa is incomplete without spending multiple days lazing on the beach, embracing everything that makes Mirissa so special. WATCH THE SUNSET FROM COCONUT TREE HILL Although there are plenty of things to see and do in Mirissa, one of our favourite places to visit in Sri Lanka is the insta-famous and delightful Coconut Tree Hill . Although it’s been plastered all over social media, it really is a beautiful and unique place to see with your own eyes, with literally hundreds of palms jutting out of this small, burnt orange hill. Located at the eastern end of Mirissa Beach, the views over Mirissa are spectacular, and there are plenty of places to just chill and watch the world go by. Although it's gaining in popularity quickly, early mornings are relatively free from crowds, while a clear evening will gift you some pretty epic sunset views from here. THE DETAILS Where | Mirissa Beach How to get to Coconut Tree Hill, Mirissa | Walk along Matara Rd out of Mirissa until you reach Maison D’hotes Sanda Beach . From there, follow the path on your right and you’ll come to a gate, from which you should be able to walk directly to the palm trees. HAVE A LAZY AFTERNOON AT SECRET BEACH The secret’s out - Secret Beach is no longer a secret. And while we’re a little mad about it, good things don’t stay hidden for long. Located on a small peninsula separating Weligama and Mirissa, Secret Beach is tucked in amongst jungle and rocks, hidden away from the relative hustle of Mirissa beach and town. Punctuated by two small coves, Secret Beach beckons with its powdery golden sands and crystal-clear waters that glisten under the caress of the sun. The best part about the beach, though, is the small pool created by rocks that make swimming here a far more sedate affair, especially when the Indian Ocean is stirring. With the increase in popularity has come a range of beachside bars set back from the beach, which serves up basic food, beers and cocktails. Sit under the towering coconut trees, and enjoy the breeze while sipping a king coconut, before returning back to the sea. You could easily spend the whole day here, but we suggest a half day so you have time to explore the other best things to do in Mirissa. Getting to Secret Beach requires either a tuk-tuk or two legs. The former is fairly pricey, however, if you can handle the heat, we suggest walking there. The road passes typical Sri Lankan houses and shops, and it gives a great insight into daily life in Sri Lanka, away from the resorts. It’s about 4km return, so remember to pack your water bottle, or stop and grab a coconut to rehydrate. THE DETAILS Where | Secret Beach, Mirissa How to get to Secret Beach | Follow this map for the best way to get to Secret Beach TAKE A WHALE WATCHING EXPEDITION Sri Lanka is home to an array of exceptional National Parks, which host a huge diversity of wildlife; 44 mammal species including elephants and leopards, and over 215 bird species, to be exact! For such a small country, the wealth of wildlife viewing opportunities are virtually unmatched globally. However, it’s not just on land that Sri Lanka’s wildlife viewing opportunities exist, but also in the ocean. Off the southern coast of Sri Lanka, it’s possible to observe a range of whale species, and dolphins, in their natural habitat. Between December - March, the waters of the Indian Ocean play host to migrating Blue Whales (dolphins, Bryde’s whales and sperm whales are sometimes also observed), which provide perfect whale-watching opportunities through a range of local operators. If you’re in Sri Lanka during this period, we highly recommend joining a whale-watching expedition . Tours depart from Mirissa, where medium-sized cruisers take to the ocean in search of these incredible creatures. This popular 4-6 hour whale watching tour is limited to a group of 40, providing greater whale viewing opportunities. The tour also includes breakfast, tea and coffee, as well as a highly trained crew and a tour. If you’re prone to motion sickness, be warned - the tours are often bumpy, so take precautions to avoid falling ill. THE DETAILS Where | Tour departs from Mirissa, Sri Lanka BOOK | Whale watching tour STEP OUT ONTO PARROT ROCK The vast Mirissa beach is punctuated by the tiny, ochre-coloured tidal island covered with vegetation, known as Parrot Rock. Parrot Rock, named because it may or may not resemble a parrot (we’re undecided), has the most scenic view of Mirissa Beach and is another perfect place to watch the sunset (or sunrise, for that matter) after Coconut Tree Hill. The rock itself is small and its position between two beaches means it’s highly susceptible to tides - at high tide, you can’t walk out, but at low tide, you can. A set of stairs leads you up to a small grassy knoll, where you can take the pretty spectacular view in. To your right, the vast Mirissa Beach, and in front, a coconut palm-fringed peninsula. It all makes for the perfect snapshot of Mirissa, and definitely worth of a quick pit stop between Coconut Tree Hill and a beachside cocktail bar. THE DETAILS Where | Parrot Rock, Mirissa LEARN TO SURF AT NEARBY WELIGAMA The whole southern coast of Sri Lanka is a surfer’s paradise; awesome breaks at just about every corner attract sliders from all over the world. For beginner surfers like us (we know, we’re terrible Australians!), it's also a great place to learn, with warm waters, cheap boards and easy waves the perfect combination to catch that first wave. The best place to learn to surf along the coast is Weligama, located around 2.5 hours south of Colombo or 30 minutes from the popular town of Unawatuna . Built for surfers, there are hundreds of surf schools located right on the beach - just turn up, speak to a tout and you’ll be learning your way around a board just a few minutes later. A 1 - 1.5 hour lesson costs around LKR 2,500 per person, and will teach you the basics of surfing including how to stand up, paddling for a wave, surfing etiquette, and safety. Somehow, we both managed to stand within our first five waves, and the thrill was incredible. We're now 100% converted to surfing. If Weligama isn't your jam, you can learn to surf in many places on the south and east coast, including Unawatuna , Hiriketiya , and Arugam Bay. After a surf, go hang out with the legends at Ceylon Sliders , a boutique hotel-cum-cafe-cum-surf store celebrating surf culture in Sri Lanka. They happen to have some of the best food in Sri Lanka, as well as the coolest staff we've ever met. THE DETAILS Where | Weligama, Sri Lanka Cost | Lessons cost around LKR 2,500pp Where to stay in Weligama | We recommend staying at Ceylon Sliders . Alternatively, search and book your Weligama accommodation here TAKE A DAY TRIP TO ALLURING GALLE FORT In our opinion, Galle Fort is one of the unmissable points of interest on any Sri Lankan itinerary . The Fort is unlike any other place we’ve found in Sri Lanka; a vaguely European-feeling city plonked in the deliciously salty tropics, a melting pot of culture and religion bursting with colour, and where, thankfully, the taste of Ceylon tea and cinnamon is never far away. The Fort is rapidly gentrifying as chic boutiques, cafes, and hotels begin to restore the whitewashed Dutch colonial buildings back to their former glory, but it only takes ducking down a quiet laneway to feel as though you’ve travelled back to the 1700s again. Alluring, exotic, and totally loveable, Galle Fort is one of the unmissable points of interest on your Sri Lankan itinerary. There is a heap of must-sees (we've written a blog post about the best things to do in Galle Fort ) including: Galle Lighthouse Explore the exterior and interior of the Galle Fort, and visit the historical sights Shop till you drop. Galle Fort has the best shopping we encountered in all of Sri Lanka Watch the technicolour sunset from the Fort walls THE DETAILS Where | Galle Fort Where to stay in Galle | Search and book Galle Fort accommodation here READ | Our comprehensive Galle Fort guide , where to stay in Galle Fort WHERE TO EAT AND DRINK IN MIRISSA BRUNCH AT SHADY LANE A Mirissa institution, Shady Lane is a Bali-style oasis, where culinary delights blend harmoniously with the tropical paradise that surrounds you. Set amongst the humble streets of Mirissa, Shady Lane has been serving up delightfully colourful brunches and smoothie bowls for years now, and it never disappoints. Definitely one of our favourite places to eat in Mirissa, and even along the southern coast, we highly suggest the avo toast, banana oat pancakes and a smoothie bowl. Portions are super generous (you won’t leave hungry), but prices are a little higher than elsewhere. Beyond the boho-concrete ambience, there’s a small shop to buy jewellery, clothes and other local products. LOCAL DELIGHTS AT DEWMINI ROTI SHOP Speaking of Sri Lankan institutions, Dewmini Roti Shop might be Mirissa’s #1-rated restaurant, serving up rice & curry, kottu, and their famous roti’s. Hidden away in the streets of Mirissa, it feels as if you’re sitting in the owner’s backyard (well, you kind of are). It makes the ambience all the more wonderful. Food is made on site, using local-sourced ingredients and the result is perfection - dishes bursting with flavour. We suggest the kottu rotti, which might just be the best in Lanka. If you’re feeling naughty, definitely try the mango & chocolate roti… nom. Prices are affordable, which is probably why this place is so popular. They also offer cooking classes, which by all accounts are hands-on and wonderfully authentic. EXCEPTIONAL GELATO AT MILKY WAVE We love Sri Lankan cuisine. In fact, it might be our favourite cuisine in the world. However, eating rice and curry for lunch and dinner each day can leave a little curried out. Thankfully, Mirissa is filled with Western-style restaurants, and one that stands out is the Italian-inspired Milky Wave. Set in a large, palm-covered courtyard, Milky Wave serves up homemade pasta made with fresh ingredients and hits the spot every time. The best part though, is the range of homemade gelato, which rivals any we’ve had in Europe - think thick, creamy, flavourful gelato using local ingredients. It makes for the perfect afternoon/post-dinner snack. The cheesecake is a winner, too. VEGAN GOODNESS AT THE SLOW Vegetarians and vegans have it fairly easy in Sri Lanka, with the majority of curries served without meat. But beyond curries, it’s slim pickings. Enter, The Slow. The Slow's vegan offerings are an invitation to savour the art of conscious dining. The menu is a range of plant-based delights, including vegan starters, pasta dishes, burgers, healthy bowls and middle-eastern inspired dishes. The boho-chic Slow is set right on the beach, beneath palm trees and with stunning views, and it really is a uber-cool place to spend a day. We recommend arriving for lunch and spending the afternoon enjoying food, cocktails and a swim, before watching sunset. Oh, and you can stay here too. The rooms are tropical minimal with large windows and doors that open to the ocean - the type you never want to leave. NICE CREAM AND COFFEE AT ALOHA COFFEE GALLERY Tucked away in the narrow streets between Mirissa town and Coral Surf Beach is Aloha, a small cafe serving brunch, nice cream, and Mirissa’s best coffee. Modern, convivial, and relaxing, Aloha is everything you need after a morning in the water. Everything here is fresh and homemade, and the nice cream in particular is wildly popular.

Beautiful Mirissa is located on the southern coast of Sri Lanka, around 150 km from the capital, Colombo, and just a short drive to some of Sri Lanka’s popular beachside enclaves, including Galle, Unawatuna, and Weligama. HOW LONG SHOULD YOU SPEND IN MIRISSA? The length of time you wish to spend in Mirissa really depends on how long you’re planning to spend in Sri Lanka. For short itineraries, we suggest spending 2 nights in Mirissa, before exploring more of the Southern Coast (Hiriketiya is best), or Udawalawe National Park and up to Ella. For longer itineraries, 3 - 5 nights is agreeable, allowing you to enjoy the best things to do in Mirissa, while also relaxing and enjoying some beach time. Either way, a stop in Mirissa is essential to any Sri Lanka itinerary . WHEN IS THE BEST TIME TO VISIT MIRISSA? Anytime from October - April is a good time to visit Mirissa Beacg, as the monsoon rains have passed and the temperatures are fairly stable. That being said, the absolute BEST time to visit is between February - April , when low rainfall and calmer seas provide the perfect weather to explore. We’ve been told to avoid visiting during early January when Sri Lankan holidays occur and Mirissa is teeming with local tourists. HOW TO GET TO MIRISSA // TAXI / PRIVATE CAR By far the quickest and most comfortable option, taking a taxi or private transfer to Mirissa will save you time, but cost a lot more than other options. If your budget permits, we suggest taking a taxi (we did this on our most recent trip and it was wonderful). THE DETAILS Cost | LKR 20,000 (AUD $100, USD $65) BOOK | Book your Airport to Mirissa transfer here , or here // TRAIN The most scenic way to get from Colombo to Mirissa is via train to either Weligama station or Matara station - at which point you’ll need to take a taxi or tuk-tuk onwards to Mirissa. The train, which runs along the palm-fringed coast the majority of the journey, is one of the best in Sri Lanka. The Colombo Fort to Southern Coast trains departs 7 times a day (less on weekends), with the earliest departure at 6:55 am and the final departure at 18:05. It takes around 1.5 hours. We recommend travelling outside of peak hours to avoid packed trains and an uncomfortable j", "images":

Discover the best things to do, where to eat and stay and all the essential information UPDATED JULY 2025 The hues of Agios Prokopios almost force even the most seasoned of travellers into travel cliches - all those overused shades of azure and turquoise, the endless golden sands and rows of vibrant sunbeds - but Naxos ’ most popular beach genuinely earns each and every one. Agios Prokopios is your quintessential Mediterranean summer holiday destination, a kind of beach, filled with beach clubs, sunbeds, and water sports. The beach feels endless — a wide sweep of golden sand and some of the most gorgeous turquoise water on Naxos (there we go again!). This is the kind of beach you’ll want to settle into — sprawled out on a sunbed with a book in hand and a cocktail nearby, breaking only for a dip every half hour. Just beyond the sand, you’ll find a laid-back town with no-frills tavernas, affordable accommodation, and plenty of beachside activities for those who prefer a bit more action. In this guide to Agios Prokopios beach, we share the best things to do, where to stay, where to eat, how to get there, and plenty more essential travel information. LOVE OUR PHOTOS? Edit like us with our European Summers Preset Packs , and mobile video filters , inspired by the warm hues and vibes of summers spent in Europe AGIOS PROKOPIOS SNAPSHOT WHERE | Agios Prokopios Beach, Naxos Island HOW TO GET THERE | 15 minutes from Chora town, 5 minutes from Plaka beach THINGS TO DO | Relax at the beach bars, swim, snorkelling/diving WHERE TO EAT & DRINK | Giannoulis Taverna, Lefto’s kebabs, Del Mar AGIOS PROKOPIOS BEACH You’ll find Agios Prokopios around 10 minutes south of Naxos’ capital, Chora . This south-western stretch of Naxian coastline is popular with tourists due to its array of stunning long white sandy beaches. Agios Prokopios is one of the largest of these stretches, and with views over to Paros Island , it’s also one of the most picturesque. Agios Prokopios is one of those rare Mediterranean beaches that offers something for everyone: there are beach bars, bougie sunbeds and cocktails-aplenty for some, and endless stretches of sand for others wishing to eschew all comforts and enjoy a more relaxed day on their own terms (more on all of these options below). It’s worth noting there are no public amenities on Prokopios beach , so if you’re in need of a toilet or shower you’ll either have to wait until you get back to your accommodation or stump up for one beach bars. Parking is available in the large open area between the beach and the nearby salt flats, but it can get hectic in summer. Arrive early if you're driving, or head to the quieter western end of the beach. Supplies-wise, you’ll find several small supermarkets just off the beach selling snacks, drinks, and beach gear. There’s a more substantial Spar located just outside of town on the way to Naxos Chora ; great for stocking up if you’re staying in an apartment! THINGS TO DO AT AGIOS PROKOPIOS BEACH LAZE AT THE BEACH BARS, OR ON THE BEACH Although Naxos’ best beach clubs are found on nearby Plaka Beach, Agios Prokopios still holds its own: the long, white-sand stretch is dotted with relaxed, boho-chic bars and restaurants, many offering sunbeds and cabanas right at the water’s edge. For now, at least, Mykonos pricing hasn’t quite made its way here — so a comfortable beach day is still (comparatively) affordable. Our favourite beach bar on Agios Prokopios was Kahlua . With a boho-Mediterranean design and chilled tunes, it makes for a relaxed day by the sea. The menu offers classic beach fare - burgers, salads, sandwiches and burritos - alongside a range of smoothies, cocktails and beers (best enjoyed in that order). The sunbeds and beach area are well maintained, and the staff are some of the friendliest around. Hire a set of beach beds (2 beds and 1 Umbrella - prices vary depending on which row and season) and enjoy the vibes. Other beach bars in the area that are worth your time include: Del Mar , an Italian restaurant-cum-bar serving Italian favourites such as pizza, pasta and tiramisu Macao Beach Naxos for a South American-infused day on the Med, Sensu , a chic new arrival for 2025 (more on this one below!) If beach bars aren’t your thing, and you’d prefer to enjoy a stretch of sand without others around, the undeveloped western part of the beach is perfect for a flop-drop-float kind of day. The calm shallow waters also make this area perfect for families with small kids too READ MORE | Our guide to Plaka Beach, Naxos GO DIVING OFF AGIOS PROKOPIOS If you want to experience a different side of Naxos, head to Blue Fin Divers , a PADI 5-Star Resort located right on Agios Prokopios Beach. Whether you're a total beginner or a seasoned diver, they offer a range of snorkelling and diving experiences to suit all. There are guided snorkels that explore Naxos’ crystal-clear waters and vibrant marine life. For divers, there are more than 10 incredible dive sites around the island, including colourful reefs, historic shipwrecks, and even WWII wreckage, like the Beaufighter Plane wreck — a British WWII aircraft still largely intact, now transformed into a thriving artificial reef. Courses start from €60, and snorkelling sessions from €25 (as of July 2025). THE DETAILS Where | Blue Fin Divers, Agios Prokopios, Naxos Opening Hours | 8 am - 11 pm GO SWIMMING IN THE BLUEST WATERS The waters off Agios Prokopios are likely to be some of the bluest blues you’ve ever seen in your life - so strikingly vivid you’ll want to drop everything and dive right in. The beach stretches long with shallow waters, making it perfect for hours of floating, wading and swimming. We spent many mornings here and can confidently say it’s one of the best swimming spots on the island. While it lacks the rocky reeks of nearby Plaka beach , you can still snorkel from the shore here and spot some aquatic life. Grab some snorkelling gear from any mini market in town. One caveat: the Meltemi winds can make Agios Prokopios quite windy and sometimes uncomfortable, especially in late July and August. Check the forecast or ask a local before heading out. WATCH A MOVIE AT THE OUTDOOR CINEMA In the heart of Prokopios lies the Art Cafe, a local institution that puts on an Art Festival over the summer months. On top of live music and art, there’s a pop up outdoor cinema that (weather permitting) showcases a range of Hollywood favourites under the stars. For €10, you get a drink, a snack and a seat to watch a movie, which, if you ask us, is ridiculous value. But value can’t be placed on the experience - there’s literally nothing as cool as watching a movie outdoors with the light summer breeze, and drink in hand. Beyond the outdoor cinema, there is a variety of programs, including musical performances (mostly jazz and Greek) and art installations which may take your fancy. WHERE TO EAT & DRINK AT AGIOS PROKOPIOS Agios Prokopios is home to a large number of restaurants, with a range of really good traditional options, and some varied international fare including Italian. Although Naxos is a foodie paradise, we found the food options here fell short of our expectations - far better options exist at close by Plaka beach . But for ease, affordable prices, and ambience, Prokopios is a good option for those staying in town. Here are a few of our favourite options: LEFTO’S SOUVLAKI & KEBAB HOUSE Lefto’s was suggested to us by a friend and boy did it not disappoint. Lefto’s does perhaps our favourite gyros in all of the Cyclades (we had the halloumi and vegan options), with the ingredients super fresh, the halloumi moist, and the flavours exceptional. So much so, that we came here almost every day. On top of that, it’s super affordable, and the staff are so friendly, making a real effort to smile and say hello each day. GIANNOULIS TAVERNA Another recommendation from our local friends, family-run Giannoulis is definitely the best taverna in Prokopios, and the lines out the front each night attest to that. Serving a range of traditional Naxian and Greek cuisine, the food here is tasty, although we did find better elsewhere on the island. We suggest the Dakos salad, the mussel risotto, and a range of small bites including the fava spread, and zucchini balls. The complimentary ouzo and yoghurt & honey to finish our meal was a wonderful touch too (Greek hospitality is something we’ll never get over!). DEL MAR For a laid-back meal just steps from the sand, Del Mar is a solid choice. Located just off Agios Prokopios beach, it’s a summer favourite for no-frills Italian-Greek fare at reasonable prices. If you go, we recommend sticking with the pasta, which is the star of the show here anyway. We had the spaghetti agio e olio and it was flavoursome and delicious. The pizza, on the other hand, didn’t quite hit the mark. That said, the service is warm and welcoming, and the setting is relaxed, making it a lovely spot for a casual evening after the beach. SENSU BEACH BAR A newcomer to the Agios Prokopios dining scene (it opened in 2025), upmarket beachfront restaurant and bar Sensu celebrates Naxian ingredients and Cycladic flavours in laid-back luxury. Enjoy a handcrafted cocktail and classic beach bites under their signature umbrellas, or head to the restaurant for fresh, locally sourced seafood and a crisp glass of wine - all served with a side of Naxian sunset and warm hospitality. WHERE TO STAY NEAR AGIOS PROKOPIOS Agios Prokopios is filled with accommodation options, from hotel rooms to self-contained apartments. Pricing here tends to sit at the more affordable end of the scale, and while it’s not the most luxurious found on the island, if you’re after a cheap and cheerful stay with no frills (and prefer to spend your money on experiences instead), Agios Prokopios is a great base .

Check prices and availability READ MORE | Our guide to the best hotels on Naxos PLAN YOUR TRIP TO AGIOS PROKOPIOS HOW TO GET TO AGIOS PROKOPIOS Agios Prokopios is super easy to get to, with a range of transport options making for a simple trip from Chora town , or Plaka Beach . BY BUS Take Line #1 from Naxos Chora; the journey takes ~20-30 minutes (depending on traffic). Services run every 30min in summer - get there early as it gets busy (and pushy)! See the Naxos bus timetable here Tickets from Chora to Prokopios should cost ~€1.80 in 2025. Tickets need to be bought prior to boarding - find them at tourist markets throughout the Island. BY CAR If you have a car (though not necessary if you’re staying central), you’ll find plenty of parking at Agios Prokopios - particularly in the southeast Search and book car rental on Naxos BY SCOOTER / ATV Again, there’s parking near Prokopios beach. There are plenty of places to rent scooters on Naxos; however, we recommend Naxos On the Road Note that to rent a scooter in Greece, you'll need to show proof of a motorbike license. HOW LONG SHOULD YOU SPEND ON NAXOS? Being the largest island in the Cyclades, there are many things to see and do on Naxos , so we recommend staying for five nights. That might sound like a lot to those wanting to Island hop throughout the summer, but it’s cheaper than many other popular islands such as Santorini or Mykonos, so spending more time here will stretch your holiday dollars further. THE BEST TIME TO VISIT AGIOS PROKOPIOS Naxos is prone to the summer northern winds ( meltemi ), which can make the most popular parts of the island, including Agios Prokopios beach, extremely windy. The Meltemi peaks around July and August and while it doesn’t detract from the beauty of Prokopios, it can make a day spent there quite uncomfortable. Think blowing sand, choppy waves, and constant wind blowing your hair every which way. On top of the Meltemi winds, Agios Prokopios beach (and surrounds) gets super busy with tourists during this time - and prices also increase dramatically for things like food, drinks and sunbeds. That’s why we suggest visiting Naxos during the shoulder seasons of late April - early June, and mid-September - October. The days are still long and the weather and sea are warm, but the crowds are smaller, prices more affordable, and environmental impact reduced, making the island far more enjoyable for everyone.

UPDATED JULY 2025 At the heart of Naxos island , both geographically and culturally, you’ll find Naxos Chora (Naxos Town). Often overshadowed by the flashier capitals of its Cycladic neighbours, Naxos has, until recently at least, largely avoided much of the high-gloss tourism that defines other parts of the region. At first glance, it feels like a functional tourist port: ferries come and go, suitcases clatter across uneven cobblestones, and the hum of cutlery and chatter from touristy eateries buzzes all around. But wander into any of the narrow, twisting alleys off the main promenade and you’ll find an authentic, lived-in town that time and tourism has largely left untouched; somewhat surprising considering that Chora has played host throughout history to traders, invaders, and now a new generation of Google Maps-wielding travellers. Birds skitter past dozing cats in the marble laneways, neighbours stop to chat in quiet corners, shopkeepers close for a midday siesta, and the scent of bougainvillaea and grilled eggplant wafts through the heat. All winding lane - which once may have confounded marauding invaders and now confuse tourists instead - eventually lead to the hilltop Kastro , the 13th-century Venetian fortress with stunning views over the town. It’s worlds away from the island’s packed beaches and the iconic Portara Gate ruins (a sunset must!), and there’s a lot to love about that. There are rooftop sunset bars, delicious eateries and boutique stays, yes — but they sit comfortably alongside homes that have been lived in for generations. It all makes for a thoroughly wonderful little town, and one which, if given time, we think you’ll come to love. This Naxos Chora guide shows you the best of the town, including what to see and do, where to eat and drink, and the best accommodation options in Naxos old town. LOVE OUR PHOTOS?

Naxos Chora is situated in the west of the island, almost directly opposite Paros. Chora is the main port on Naxos, and as a result, is the main starting point to almost all Naxian adventures. THE BEST TIME TO VISIT NAXOS Long-time readers of this blog already know that no matter the destination, we always suggest visiting during shoulder season (either side of peak). For Naxos, this means late April - early June, when the island is green and lush, and mid-September - October, when the tourists have departed and the island slows down again. For Naxos Chora, if you’re planning a day visit, try to arrive early to avoid the harsh midday sun. Alternatively, arrive in the late afternoon to see the city in golden light, before settling down for a cocktail with a view, and dinner under fairylights. HOW LONG SHOULD YOU SPEND IN NAXOS CHORA (NAXOS TOWN)? You could easily see and experience the best things to do in Naxos Chora in a day, as the town is compact enough to walk between most key attractions. However, given the myriad of restaurants and bars in the town, we’d recommend visiting more than once (if you’re not staying within its reaches, of course), depending on how long you plan to visit Naxos Island . We spent four weeks on the island, so visited Chora many times, and each time we further warmed to it - it’s no Mykonos , Naoussa , or Oia , but it’s quite an authentic town with history hidden on almost every corner. WHERE TO STAY IN NAXOS CHORA Naxos Chora is the ideal base for exploring the island. It’s where all bus connections depart, where catamaran day tours leave from, and where you’ll find some of the best restaurants and bars on the island to enjoy that famous Greek hospitality. Our recommended Chora hotels are listed below: AMPELOS SUITES | Gorgeous, luxurious, and modern self-contained apartments and suites located in downtown Chora, right in the heart of the action. Check prices and availability NAXOS DOWNTOWN APARTMENTS | Super modern (which is hard to find in Greece!) apartments located in Naxos Chora, 400 m from Agios Georgios Beach. Location is everything here, as are the sleek modern finishes. Check prices and availability KATERINA ROZA APARTMENTS | Affordable self-catered studios located in the heart of Naxos Chora. Surprisingly modern and cute, considering the price. A rare find! Check prices and availability Other Chora accommodation to consider: Doron Hotel Delfini Naxos Hotel Poseidon WHAT TO SEE AND DO IN CHORA, NAXOS WATCH SUNSET AT PORTARA GATE A rite of passage for any visitor to the island, watching the sunset from the iconic Portara Gate is a must-do on Naxos . Perched atop the islet of Palatia close to Chora are the marble ruins of an unfinished temple dedicated to Apollo. Lygdamis, the tyrant of Naxos, started construction in the 6th-7th century BC, however it was abandoned mid-build due to war. Today, only the grand lintel remains silently watching over Naxos - one of the most iconic sights in all of the Cycladic islands. At sunset, droves of tourists head across the small strip of land to Palatia and up the hill to watch the sunset through the gate and over the Aegean. The scenic view back towards Chora is wonderful, especially when lit by the light orange glow of the setting sun. Tip: Now, we have to say it does get pretty hectic here during the Summer, and any sense of calm is negated by the constant hum of drones, and millions of photoshoots occurring. It’s for this reason that we actually recommend coming here for sunrise. Sure, you might not get that iconic photo of the sun setting through the gate, but you’ll have the site virtually to yourself. It’s a far more peaceful way to experience one of Naxos’ most emblematic sights. THE DETAILS Where | Portara Gate, Naxos WALK THE TWISTING LANEWAYS OF THE OLD TOWN As you’ve probably already gleaned from our intro, the best way to get to know Naxos Chora is to simply spend some time wandering the winding stone streets and crumbling stairways and soaking in the side to Naxos town that many tourists don’t actually see. There’s the colourful fruit stall selling the best of Naxos’ produce, a yiayia watching the world below from her window, the clatter of cutlery and the waft of delicious food being prepared, and the ever-present radio relaying the latest news. Locals greet each other in doorways, quaint boutiques stocked with traditional Naxian goods peek out from almost-hidden alcoves, and in places around the Venetian Castle it’s so quiet you can hear the echo of your own footfall. It’s easy to get wonderfully lost in these rustic stone streets - in fact, it was one of our favourite things to do on the island! - so leave the map at home and let the cobblestones take you on a journey through Naxos Town as the locals know it. Note: Much of the town closes for a siesta in the mid-summer heat - so come early, or later in the day (5 pm) to appreciate Chora’s charms. EXPLORE THE VENETIAN CASTLE OF NAXOS Standing guard over the white-washed roofs and marble walls of Naxos Chora is the Venetian Castle of Naxos (Kastro). Built by the Venetian Conqueror, Markos II Sanoudos in 1207, the fortified settlement has been inhabited ever since. The narrow, covered laneways, historic churches, and cute courtyards make for a picturesque stroll, and there are also a number of churches and museums which are worth your time, including: The Roman Cathedral dating from the 13th century The Archaeological Museum of Naxos The Della Rocca Barozzi Venetian Museum Church of Panagia Theoskepasti Note: If mobility is an issue or the thought of climbing all those stairs is too much, you can take the elevator which will deposit you at Avaton Cafe Strolling through this historic quarter is one of the best things to do on Naxos , so to understand it better, we recommend joining this castle walking tour NAXOS HARBOUR It’s a curious thing in the Greek Islands that harbours tend to be the ugliest parts of the island - a kind of get in, get out place best avoided after dark. Naxos Harbour, though, is the place to be as the sun starts its slow descent into the Aegean. Small, picturesque and with the pretty backdrop of Naxos Castle, an afternoon stroll, followed by a lazy cocktail at one of the many bars, is essential. The southern end is where the best tavernas, bars and vibes are at, including our favourite Dal Professore (more restaurant recommendations below!) ENJOY COCKTAILS AT A CHORA SUNSET BAR Watching a Greek sunset is a ritual; watching it with a cocktail in hand is an essential part of said ritual. Every day, the Naxos harbour is bathed in golden light and people from all over descend on the many bars to watch the visual spectable as the sun dips behind the western mountains. . There are a huge array of bars in Chora, but our favourite is 520 Cocktail Bar & Restaurant , a boho-chic bar serving some of the best cocktails on Naxos, and with views for days. If 520 is full, a few other recommendations are: Avaton 1739 Labyrinth Wine Bar Drink in Peace Notos Art Club Flamingo Like Home Bar WANDER THE NAXOS OLD MARKET Within the old town is Naxos old market street, a labyrinth of typical tourist stores selling souvenirs such as linen, shirts, magnets, soaps etc, and boutiques, art, design, jewellery and craft stores. We actually found Naxos market the best in the Cycladic islands, with reasonable prices, original pieces and a more laidback shopping experience than those found in Santorini, Mykonos or Paros. Stop by Pocket Gallery for some great contemporary ceramics (we’d have bought them all if we weren’t travelling) and art pieces. BUY SOME ICONIC GREEK SANDALS Name a more iconic souvenir from the Greek Islands than your own pair of handcrafted traditional Greek sandals, we’ll wait. Down a narrow side street in old town Naxos, just a stone’s throw from the bustling port, you’ll find Pagonis Sandals , the family business that’s been crafting custom made traditional Greek Sandals with love here for more than 80 years. Now in its third generation of shoe-making and with a small team producing hundreds of shoes by hand each week in the workshop attached to the store, Pagonis is the name to know when it comes to quality shoes in the islands. Pop by their bustling shop to pick up a pair of your own sandals, either straight off the shelf or by ordering a custom size or design of your choosing, and stay to watch as the team transform leather into fashion right before your eyes. Tip: Be sure to visit early in your trip, orders can take a minimum of 3-4 days to make, (sometimes more during peak travel periods) — and take it from Mim who has worn her own pair of custom Pagonis sandals almost every day since our visit, you don’t want to miss out! THE DETAILS Where | Paparigopoulou, Naxos When | Hours vary, but open most days Tips | Visit the shop early on in your trip to avoid disappointment: shoes take at least 3-4 days to produce Read | Meet the Craftsmen Behind Pagonis Sandals, Naxos' Most Famous Shoes KIRIAKOS TZIBLAKIS LOCAL PRODUCTS Recommend by our local friends, Tziblakis Local Products is Naxos’ oldest traditional market store. Traditional baskets hang outside this picturesque store, however, it’s inside where the magic happens. Adorning the walls from roof to the floor is a range of traditional goods - a range of nuts, dried fruits, Greek honey and herb and spice mixes on display - but make sure to taste (and buy) the local olive oil & olives, the homemade marmalades, and the delicious Naxian cheeses made from local shepherds (xinotiro, kefalotyri, xinomizithra, graviera and mizithra). If you really want to understand the history and culture of Naxos , you could do worse than visiting here. THE DETAILS Where | Tziblakis Local Products TRY YOUR HAND AT WINDSURFING OR PADDLE BOARDING Naxos is home to some of the best windsurfing and wind foiling conditions in the world, bringing people from all over the globe to take advantage of the blustery summer winds. Just a short walk from Naxos Chora is Agios Georgios Beach and its flat-water lagoon, which provides the perfect conditions for windsurfing, paddle boarding, and all manner of watersports. Flisvos Sports Club is the perfect place to join a lesson and learn the essentials of windsurfing. The staff here are absolutely amazing - they live and breath the sport, and they’re also awesome teachers who will help you catch the first gust of wind easily. If windsurfing isn’t your vibe, or the wind is low, do what we did and jump aboard a paddle board to explore the lagoon and beach down to Chora instead Check rental and lesson prices here . THE DETAILS Where | Flisvos Sports Club, Naxos Cost | 3-day beginner Lessons start from €230 (as of 2025) SAMPLE DELICIOUS LOUKOUMADES No trip to Greece, and indeed Naxos is complete without a serving of diabetes-inducing Loukoumades, Greek doughnuts served in a sea of honey and topped with cinnamon. We stopped by Padelis Coffee Shop on the recommendation of a local, and the loukoumades we sampled were easily the best we tried in the Cycladic islands - crisp on the outside, moist on the inside, and with delicious local honey to top it off. THE DETAILS Where | Padelis Coffee Shop WHERE TO EAT & DRINK IN NAXOS CHORA Hungry? You’ll need to be on Naxos. Home to some of the best produce on the Mediterranean, Naxos is a food-lovers dream destination. Its vast range of natural springs and mineral rich soil, which ensures a sufficient yield for local farmers - and this bounty of goods is heaven for tourists interested in sampling the local food culture. Throughout Naxos Chora, tavernas champion local produce and dishes, including Naxian Potatoes, Naxian Gruyere, seafood and local game. Below is a list of our recommended restaurants, which served up very good fare. Some are on the pricier side, and some are hidden gems: DAL PROFESSORE | Exceptional Italian with sunset views on Naxos Harbour. Pasta is fresh and expertly cooked. Try the Ravioli di magro (ravioli with butter and sage), and TO ELLINIKO RESTAURANT | Set in the backstreets of Chora Naxos, To Elliniko is casual dining at its finest. Except the food here is really good. The zucchini fritters, fried cheese and home made pie are gorgeous but the real star for us was the fresh sea bass DOUKATO | For delicious Naxian fare with flare you’ll definitely want to check out Doukato, with its gorgeous courtyard, mouthwatering food and friendly service. Get the octopus, and make a reservation! SARRIS RESTAURANT | Non-descript, affordable restaurant in the heart of Chora. Seafood is a must - try the Dakos salad and fresh local Naxian Mackerel CAFE OUZERIE BARABBAS | A local secret hidden in the streets between Chora and Agios Giorgios, Barabbas serves extremely good Naxian cuisine. Seafood is the winner here, but the stuffed eggplant is a thing of beauty TAVERNA KASTRO | It’s not so much about the food here, as it is about the view and ambience. Come for sunset, and enjoy an Aperol while watching the day end, before tucking into a Greek mezze (as of July 2025 this taverna is temporarily closed) NAXOS BAKERY | Sure, bakeries are everywhere in Greece, but Naxos Bakery is truly full of the good treats! HUG ME NAXOS | A bit of a brunch/lunch/drinks all-rounder given they’re open from 8am - 3am, but if you’re after a decent breaky feed and good coffee then this is your place. Food, dishes, and drinks we recommend sampling at restaurants in Naxos Chora include: Naxian Potatoes | Naxos’ main food export, these potatoes make for great fries, their waxy texture unique and flavoursome Naxian cheeses | Perhaps the best of all Naxian produce, Naxian cheeses are varied and delicious. Gruyere is the most famous, a hard table cheese with a robust flavour, Xinomyzithra is a slighty sour cream goat’s cheese, and Arseniko, a sheep’s cheese hard in texture and salty in flavour Naxian Graviera Saganaki | Flavoursome saganaki served with honey and sesame seeds Seafood | An obvious one, considering the abundance from the Mediterranean. Calamari, Octopus, and Anchovies are always winners Patoudo | Lamb stuffed with chard, fennel, herbs and garlic Wild rabbit | Rabbit braised in lemon Rooster served with pasta | Eaten in villages, slow-cooked rooster is served with pasta Kitron | The local Naxian liqueur made from leaves of citron tree. Kitron comes in three varieties: green (sweet), yellow (strongest) and clear (the middle ground) TRAVEL INSURANCE | STAY SAFE IN GREECE If you can't afford travel insurance, you really can't afford to travel.

UPDATED JULY 2025 It took us a little while to get the measure of Naxos . We’d explored the villages, wandered the old towns, eaten more than our share of local cheese and potatoes — but it wasn’t until we spent a few long days stretched out by the sea that the island really began to click for us. Naxos doesn’t have a bad beach. There’s an honesty to its coastline too; much of it is unspoilt, fringed by dunes and scrub. Some beaches stretch like white-sand ribbons, others tucked-away-and-hard-to-find rocky coves. Some are calm and framed by taverna tables, others by nothing but wind and sea. A few have sunbeds and beach bars, of course, but the balance tips firmly towards the natural and understated. Beach days here are generally unhurried and a little rugged, much like the rest of Naxos itself. It’s this variety that also makes Naxos one of the most compelling beach destinations in the Cyclades, with a beach to be found for every beach-bod. In this guide, we break down the best beaches on Naxos, from the iconic expanse of Plaka and busy shores of Agios Prokopios to the more secluded bays hidden further afield. Whether you’re here to swim, surf, sunbake, or get just a little sozzled at a beach bar, there’s a perfect slice of shoreline for you - and maybe, like us, Naxos will make more sense by the end of it too. LOVE OUR PHOTOS? Edit like us with our European Summers Preset Packs , and mobile video filters , inspired by the warm hues and vibes of summers spent in Europe NAXOS ISLAND BEACH ESSENTIALS & FAQS WHERE TO FIND THE BEST BEACHES ON NAXOS The south-west of the island is home to the best slices of sand in Greece. Big call, but the bright white sand and turquoise water of Prokopios, Plaka, Mikri Vigla, Hawaii Beach and Glyfada are astoundingly beautiful. Of those, only the southern end of Agios Prokopios , and the northern end of Plaka beach are developed with beach bars and tavernas, which means you’ll have an excellent, relaxed experience at just about every one of the best south-eastern beaches. Quiet beaches aren’t for everyone though, so there are several exceptional beach bars and clubs located off Agios Prokopios, Plaka Beach, and Agios Georgios. The pick of these is Nomad Naxos, and Tortuga (more on that below). These beaches, plus Agia Anna, are also the best for families, with heaps of amenities and things to do for little ones. … Beyond the golden coast of the southwest, the rugged, untouched south & western coast is home to several small coves that offer some of the most authentic seaside experiences in all of Greece. Picture empty beaches, shimmering turquoise waters, sleepy tavernas and long lazy days. HOW TO GET TO THE BEST BEACHES ON NAXOS There are two options for exploring the best of Naxos’ beaches, private vehicle (car, ATV or scooter), or public transport. Having utilised both forms during our two weeks on the island, both can be great options but it really depends on your budget and which beaches you want to visit. If you’re happy exploring the beaches close to Chora or Prokopios/Plaka, walking or public transport will do. If you’d prefer to discover the more untouched beaches in the south or east, we’d recommend a car. PUBLIC TRANSPORT Buses are by far the cheapest mode of transport on Naxos, and the network is pretty good and reliable, especially between Chora and the main beaches of Prokopios, Plaka and further south. Line #1 and Line #3 will be your best friend. As of 2025, most tickets between major hubs generally cost around €1.80 (the most we paid was €2.50 for a ticket). Tickets for the Naxos bus service need to be bought before boarding and can be found at tourist markets throughout the Island. Most buses connect in and out of Chora, but also along Plaka and Prokopios beaches hourly. See the Naxos bus timetable here The buses themselves are decent; they're air-conditioned and comfortable, although in peak season they fill up seriously quickly so you may find yourself standing. They run frequently, although the timings are sometimes a little limiting when you want to pack lots of Naxos's best things to do into a single day. During the peak of summer, we'd recommend getting to the bus stop early and being prepared to queue for a while (it can also get pretty pushy!). CAR RENTAL Normally, we wouldn’t advocate hiring a car when visiting a Greek island, but the island is huge and if you have your own set of wheels, especially an air-conditioned set, it will make for a far more seamless time of visiting the best beaches on Naxos. Car rental on Naxos is actually quite affordable, especially during the shoulder seasons. Expect to pay around €25 - €50 per day for car rental on Naxos. Traffic can be an issue; plenty of locals talked about 30-minute drives stretching into traffic-clogged 2+ hour journeys through July and August, especially leading into Agios Prokopios and Chora, so keep that in mind. Due to the size and undulation of Naxos, we wouldn’t necessarily recommend scooter or ATV unless you’re exploring the area between Chora and Plaka only. Note that you’ll also need proof of a motorbike license to rent a scooter in Greece. BOOK | Search and book a car rental on Naxos WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT BEACHES ON NAXOS Before arriving at your pick of Naxos’ beaches, there are are a few important things to know: THE MELTEMI WINDS Naxos, like all the Cycladic Islands, is prone to extreme summer winds, known as the Meltemi , which can make many parts of the island extremely windy. The Meltemi is a strong, dry northerly wind that blows ferociously over the Aegean Sea. The wind funnels between the Cycladic islands which causes the speed to be intense and often, ferries to be cancelled. The winds peak around July and August. On strong wind days though, it does make life quite uncomfortable, especially if you plan to spend your days lazy by the beach - expect a mouthful of sand, and a constant breeze through your hair. Now, if you’re a windsurfer or love sailing, these winds are heavenly - especially near Agios Georgios, Orkos, and Mikri Viglia beaches, where windsurfing conditions are perfect. BEACH CLUBS VS PUBLIC BEACHES Naxos may have some of the Cyclades’ most beautiful beaches, but what sets it apart is how many remain unorganised — that is, free of beach clubs, sunbeds, and built-up amenities. For us, that’s a major part of the appeal. But if you’re after all-day parties like those on Mykonos , it might feel a little too low-key. Along the popular southwest coast — including Agios Georgios, Agios Prokopios, Agia Anna and Plaka — there’s a good mix of developed and undeveloped sections, giving you the option to enjoy a beach day your way: with or without the price tag of a sunbed and service. Beach clubs here are also more affordable than elsewhere in the Cyclades, expect to pay €50–€80 per person for the day covering a sunbed, food and drinks in peak season (expect lower prices in May–June and September). Outside of these main hubs, most beaches on Naxos are entirely public — just sand, sea, and space. NOTES ON NUDISM While there are no officially designated nudist beaches on Naxos, it is generally accepted (as long as its respectful) — and there are a couple of spots that are more well-known and popular for nudist beachgoers. These are: Plaka beach, particularly towards the southern end Agia Anna, just down from the Chapel of Agios Nikolaos (you’ll find the spot here ) Agios Prokopios, away from the more developed area THE BEST BEACHES ON NAXOS ISLAND PLAKA BEACH Plaka Beach captures what makes Naxian beaches so special: clear blue Aegean waters, endless stretches of soft white sand, a smattering of sun-kissed beachgoers and a handful of hip beach bars set among the dunes. Plaka feels a little more refined than Prokopios , but does so without losing its unspoilt charm — especially on the southeastern stretch where farmland still runs right up to the sea. It’s this best of both worlds vibe that made Plaka our favourite beach on the island. In the morning, you could enjoy a peaceful swim with turtles and fish for company; by afternoon, you could be lounging in a beachside cabana with a cocktail in hand and a plate of fresh seafood in front of you. If you’re seeking some beachside fuel or drinks, Plaka’s beachfront is dotted with standout spots — Tortuga, Tohu, Nomad, and Cedar Café among them. For great food and atmosphere, Tortuga is our top pick (you’ll find full reviews in our dedicated Plaka Beach guide ). Prefer to stay active? Plaka is also a hub for paddleboarding, snorkelling, and other watersports. It’s easy to get here — just a short drive from Chora or Agios Prokopios, with ample parkinbg for those with their own wheels. Regular buses operate hourly from Naxos Chora, with stops at Agios Prokopios and Agia Anna too. Just note that the final stretch of road is unsealed and kicks up a fair bit of dust. Note | Sadly, like many beautiful places, Plaka is facing increasing development — but for now, it remains one of the most beautiful and laid-back beaches in the Cyclades. One of those ‘enjoy now, or regret later’ places. READ | Our guide to Plaka Beach THE DETAILS Where | Plaka Beach, Naxos Getting there| Car: 20 min from Chora, 5 min from Agios Prokopios Bus: Line #1 from Naxos Chora Stay | Naxian on the Beach , Dream On Plaka , or Annio Boutique Studios Plan | Plan your visit with our guide to Plaka Beach AGIOS PROKOPIOS As the most popular beach on the island, Agios Prokopos fulfils the classic summer holiday brief: lively, accessible, buzzing in summer, and postcard-perfect stretches of soft sand and clear blue water. After many days spent stretched on its shores, we can also attest that it’s one of the best beaches on Naxos. There are a few ways to enjoy this delightful stretch of coastline: stumping up for sunbeds and beach bars, or throwing down a towel and beach umbrella yourself and enjoying the public stretch. SUNBEDS If your idea is to sit back on a deck chair and read a good book, you’re in luck: the eastern part of the beach has 5+ beach bars with sunbeds for rent. Our favourite was Kahlua : good food, vibes, and a prime spot on the sand. 2025 note | Prices for sunbeds have increased since we originally wrote this guide. Expect to pay ~€30 for front row in the more developed area, with prices decreasing with each row back. For the budget-conscious, walk to the far end of the beach for more affordable loungers, you may still be able to snag two for ~€15ish. PUBLIC BEACH Prefer things more low-key? Fortunately, a large part of the beach is public, so it’s entirely possible to eschew the beach bars and make for the western end of the beach instead. Mostly undeveloped and much quieter, this is ideal for those who want space or a more family-friendly setting Just note: there are no public amenities on the beach itself, so unless you’re with a beach club, you’ll need to plan ahead for toilets and showers. Beyond the beach is a fun little town, filled with no-frills tavernas and bars, affordable accommodation, and beach & watersport activities for the adventurous. For those driving, there’s a decent-sized parking area by the salt flats, though it fills up fast in peak season. Arrive early then, or head to the western end of the beach where it’s quieter. THE DETAILS Where | Prokopios Beach , Naxos How to get there | Car: 15 minutes from Chora, 5 minutes from Plaka. Bus: Line #1 from Naxos Chora Where to stay | Naxian Collection , or Hotel Francesca Plan | Plan your visit with our Agios Prokopios guide AGIOS GEORGIOS We have a bit of a love/hate relationship with Agios Georgios. On one hand, it’s conveniently close to Naxos town and home to the wonderful little haven of Flisvos Sportsclub, a place we spent many a day and night enjoying. Protected from the summer winds by a small peninsula, the northern end of the beach is perfect for families, and there’s no shortage of tavernas and cafes to grab a relaxed bit or drink at (we recommend Flisvos, Meltemi or Barabbas). On the other, those very beach bars and proximity to Chora are what felt like drawbacks for us. It can feel a little too lively, and with quieter, more scenic options like Prokopios and Plaka nearby, we often found ourselves heading elsewhere. Still, Agios Georgios has its charms — particularly the southern end, where the Meltemi winds bring ideal conditions for windsurfing. If you're new to the sport, this is a great place to try a lesson, or do as we did and grab a paddleboard to explore the coastline at your own pace. THE DETAILS Where | Agios Georgios , Naxos Getting there | A short walk south from Naxos Chora Facilities | Beach clubs, restaurants, showers MIKRI VIGLA Mikri Vigla is another gorgeous stretch of golden sand located in the southwest of the Island. Much like Agios Georgios, Mikri Vigla is a paradise for water sports enthusiasts and one of the best beaches on Naxos for windsurfing. The beach is separated into two parts, with the northern side perfect for kite surfing and the longer, southern side ideal for windsurfing, making it a mecca for adventure seekers from all over the world. Beyond the water sports, Mikri Vigla Beach offers a relaxing atmosphere when the winds aren’t blowing, which is rare, especially in summer. There are also great swimming and snorkelling opportunities, especially on the reef to the west of the beach, when it is calm. There are no real amenities per se, and the beach remains relatively undeveloped, with only a few small tavernas and beach bars lining the shore. If you’re after a beach club, we suggest Prokopios or Plaka. For those after food and drink, we suggest Stellios restaurant, which serves simple, delicious Greek food. THE DETAILS Where | Mikri Vigla , Naxos Getting there | 30-minute drive from Naxos Chora, or a 10-minute drive from Plaka beach Facilities | Restaurant, beach bar, parking AGIA ANNA Smack in the middle of Agios Prokopios and Plaka beaches lies the gorgeous Agia Anna. Sunkissed and golden, the beach is split in two, each with a distinct personality. To the north, a narrow strip of golden sand is lined with beach bars and tavernas — it’s vibrant, lively, and ideal for a full day of lounging with a cocktail in hand. Agia Anna Beach Bar is our top pick for a relaxed setup with food, drinks, and prime people-watching. The southern stretch is more sedate and undeveloped. The wide, shallow cove is lined with colourful fishing boats, while the western corner offers smooth rock formations great for snorkelling. It’s best suited to families or those simply after a calmer beach day. Like other Naxian beaches, Agia Anna also offers paddleboarding, kayaking, and snorkelling — just check the beachside stalls for rentals. Just behind the beach you’ll find a lively village with a range of amenities including tavernas, cafes, and shops for essentials. It’s also home to a huge range of affordable accommodation just a stone’s throw from the water’s edge; for this reason we suggest those on a budget stay here. Agia Anna Beach is easily accessible from Naxos Town, by either car or local bus. If travelling by car, be warned - parking is at a premium here, so better to walk or take a bus. THE DETAILS Where | Agia Anna , Naxos Getting there | By car: 15 minutes from Chora, 5 minutes from Plaka, By bus: Line #1 from Naxos Chora Facilities | Beach bars, restaurants, small supermarkets, gelato, boutiques HAWAII BEACH You’ll find Hawaii Beach set amongst the Cedar forests in the southeastern reaches of Naxos. We visited on a whim, looking to find somewhere quiet and secluded to lay our towel for the afternoon, and as we glimpsed the beach for the first time through the Cedar forest, we knew we’d made a wonderful decision. On an island where beautiful beaches are the norm, Hawaii beach is strikingly unique; burnt orange cliffs provide a stunning backdrop to the irresistibly clear waters. Close by is the Alyko Hotel ruins and open-air street art gallery, which are well worth a look. There’s no natural shade to speak of and no amenities, so bring your own shade, snacks, and beverages as there really are no shops or eateries nearby. The beach is a 30-minute drive away from Chora, it’s this distance that gives it a more unspoilt atmosphere compared to the more developed beaches near Naxos Town. Hawaii and Alyko beaches (further down) are next to each other and can be knocked off in a single visit. THE DETAILS Where | Hawaii Beach , Naxos Getting there | By car: 30 min south-east from Naxos Chora Bus: Line #3 from Naxos Chora (45 mins) Facilities | Parking at the Alyko Hotel ruins PANERMOS BEACH They say the best beaches on Naxos are the hardest to reach — and Panermos fits the bill perfectly. Set in the more remote southeastern corner of the island, found at the end of a long, winding drive through the hill villages, Panermos is a rocky, secluded bay fringed by palms and just enough infrastructure to make it comfortable without losing its wild charm. When the main beaches are overrun, seclusion can still be found here. The beach is a mix of sand and rock, with calm, swimmable waters ideal for snorkelling, or paddle-boarding (SUP boards can be rented onsite) — or simply floating your cares away. There are only minimal amenities here; Mitatos is a lovely little restaurant serving Greek/Naxian cuisine at affordable prices. There’s also an unpretentious beach bar offering snacks, beers and cocktails, however, we suggest bringing your own water and snacks just in case either are closed. You can also join a trehantiri (small traditional boat) tour from the small jetty to the left of the beach, which visits the surrounding coves, caves, cliffs and hidden swimming holes. Learn more here . Despite its far-flung feel, Panermos is accessible by car or motorbike, with ample parking available. The drive from Naxos Chora should take around 1.5 hours. Alternatively, jump on board this full-day boat trip along the South coast of Naxos , and visit Panermos from the water. THE DETAILS Where | Panermos Beach , Naxos Getting there | Take the mountain road from Naxos Chora through Filoti, Apeiranthos and down towards Moutsouna, then follow the coastal road south towards Panermos. The drive should take 1.5 hours Facilities | Beach bar and restaurant ORKOS BEACH Between the long, golden sands of Plaka Beach and the popular windsurfing beach of Mikri Vigla, Orkos is more than just one beach, but rather a series of small coves, each framed by natural rock formations and fine sandy shores. We stumbled upon Orkos on our way to Mikri Vigla Beach, and it was love at first sight. We returned day after day, enjoying the often empty, sandy coves, swimming and relaxing the hours away, and it ended up being one of our favourite slices of sand on Naxos. There’s really nothing more to these beaches and coves - no amenities, no beach bars, no shade, just small slices of sand that you’ll enjoy as much as we did. With that in mind, we do suggest bringing supplies with you, including food and drinks, unless you’re willing to walk/drive the short trip to Mikri Vigla and the smattering of tavernas. THE DETAILS Where | Orkos Beach , Naxos Getting there | By car: 30 min from Chora, 10 min from Plaka Bus: Line #1 from Naxos Chora (35 mins) Facilities | None PARALIA GLYFADA The further south from Agios Prokopios and Plaka you venture, the more unspoilt the beaches become, which is largely the appeal of Naxos. Paralia Glyfada is one such beach; an expansive stretch of fine, golden sand lapped by crystal-clear waters. There’s no real development here, save for a small number of villas, and one or two tavernas, while a small number of beach bars pop up during summer. Other than that, it’s empty and glorio", "images": ["https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5a3bb03b4c326d76de73ddaa/952e5598-19f3-4976-87b1-4212703df0c8/The_Common_Wanderer_-4.jpg",

UPDATED - JUNE 2025 We never planned to visit Naxos. Like many first-timers to the Cyclades, we were lured by the big-hitters of Santorini , Mykonos , Paros , and Milos — and Naxos simply didn’t make the final cut. But, as anyone with a good story of unexpected destinations and changed itineraries can attest, travel often has a way of rerouting plans. When the opportunity came up to photograph some hotels during our eight weeks in the Islands, we found ourselves boarding a ferry from Paros with a healthy crowds of other holiday-makers, curiosity piqued. That evening, sitting barefoot on the beach with a Naxian Spritz in hand and a stunning Aegean sunset before us, our Naxian love affair quietly commenced. Unlike it’s louder Cycladic neighbours, Naxos doesn’t rely on spectacle. There are no influencer-stacked beach clubs, no ‘see or be seen’ party scenes, no velvet ropes to cross, nor overly curated moments to chase. Instead, the island is generous in all the best ways. Its landscapes are wild and varied; limestone peaks and fertile valleys give way to golden bays and quiet coves. It’s the food bowl of the Cyclades, brimming with olive trees, citrus groves, vineyards, and the humble potato — a staple so beloved, it even has its own annual festival . The villages feel lived in. The tavernas are full of families, not just day-trippers. There are real local stories layered into each stone and street, and space — both literally and figuratively — to breathe (especially when the meltemi winds arrive!). In one unhurried day, you might explore ancient Byzantine ruins, wander through ancient towns , windsurf or swim in clear blue waters , and savour slow-cooked local dishes - and still find time to stretch our by the pool with a book in hand. Make no mistake, the travel crowds grow larger each year but somehow, it’s still a place where life seems to continue mostly as it always has. A version of the Cyclades that still feels wonderfully intact. We came for a few days. We stayed for a month. In that time, we explored just about every corner — and in this guide, you’ll find everything you need to make the best of your trip, including how to get here, where to stay and what to eat, the best beaches , villages , unexpected finds, and more. Just remember to go slow: Naxos rewards those who take their time. LOVE OUR PHOTOS?

THINGS TO DO ON NAXOS EXPLORE NAXOS CHORA Although not blessed with the picturesque beauty of Santorini’s Oia , the old-world charm of Naoussa , or even the hedonism of Mykonos Town, Naxos Chora (Naxos town) is equally fascinating and in many ways more appealing. The historic quarter is as authentic as they come, a myriad of narrow laneways and arches, seemingly designed to confuse the heck out of pirates in the early days. There’s lots to see and do here, and a walk through its time-worn narrow laneways is essential. Not in a rush? Read our complete Chora Town guide Chora guide here . WALK THE TWISTING LANEWAYS OF THE OLD TOWN For those willing to step away from Naxos promenade, there’s a Naxos that time (and tourism) has left untouched. It’s world’s away from the jam-packed beaches and touristy Portara Gate, and there’s a lot to love about that. Birds skitter along crumbling stairways and white-washed cobblestones, and in places around the Venetian Castle, it’s so quiet you can hear the echo of your own footfall. There’s the colourful fruit stall selling the best of Naxos’ produce, an elderly yiayia watching the world from her window, the waft of delicious local feasts being prepared, the clanging of cutlery and ever-present radio a constant soundtrack. It’s easy to get wonderfully lost in these rustic stone streets - in fact, it was one of our favourite things to do on the island! - so leave the map at home and let the cobblestones take you on a journey. Tip: much of the town closes for a siesta in the mid-summer heat - so come early or later in the day (5 pm) to appreciate Chora’s charms. VENETIAN CASTLE OF NAXOS Perched above the rooftops of Naxos Chora with views over the sparkling harbour lies the Venetian Castle of Naxos. Built in 1207 by Venetian Conqueror, Markos II Sanoudos, this fortified settlement has been inhabited ever since. The narrow, covered laneways, historic churches, and cute courtyards make for a picturesque stroll, and there are also a number of churches and museums which are worth your time, including: The Roman Cathedral dating from the 13th century The Archaeological Museum of Naxos The Della Rocca Barozzi Venetian Museum Church of Panagia Theoskepasti Strolling through this historic quarter is one of the best things to do on Naxos, so to understand it better, we recommend joining this castle walking tour NAXOS HARBOUR + SUNSET BARS The curious thing about the Greek Islands is that harbours often tend to be the ugliest parts of the island - a kind of get in, get out place best avoided after dark. Naxos Harbour, though, is the place to be as the sun starts its slow descent into the Aegean. Small, picturesque, and with the pretty backdrop of Naxos Castle, an afternoon stroll followed by a lazy cocktail at one of the many bars is essential. NAXOS OLD MARKET Deep within the old town is Naxos market, a typical labyrinth of tourist stores selling souvenirs such as linen, shirts, magnets, soaps etc, and boutiques, art, design, jewellery and craft stores. We actually found Naxos market the best in the Cyclades, with reasonable prices, original pieces and a more laidback shopping experience than those found in Santorini , Mykonos or Paros . Stop by Pocket Gallery for some great contemporary ceramics (we’d have bought them all if we weren’t travelling) and art pieces. KIRIAKOS TZIBLAKIS LOCAL PRODUCTS Recommend by our local friends, Tziblakis Local Products is a traditional market store which is Naxos’ oldest. Traditional baskets hang outside this picturesque store, however, it’s inside where the magic happens. Adorning the walls from roof to the floor is a range of traditional goods - a range of nuts, dried fruits, Greek honey and herb and spice mixes on display - but make sure to taste (and buy) the local olive oil & olives, the homemade marmalades, and the delicious Naxian cheeses made from local shepherds (xinotiro, kefalotyri, xinomizithra, graviera and mizithra). If you really want to understand the history and culture of Naxos, you could do worse than visiting here. SAMPLE SOME LOUKOUMADES No trip to Greece, and indeed Naxos is complete without a serving of diabetes-inducing Loukoumades, Greek doughnuts served in a sea of honey and topped with cinnamon. We stopped by Padelis Coffe Shop on the recommendation of a local friend, and the loukoumades we sampled were easily the best we tried in the Cycladic islands - crisp on the outside, moist on the inside, and with delicious local honey to top it off. SUNSET OR SUNRISE AT PORTARA GATE Just offshore from Chora, on the tiny islet of Palatia, the iconic marble Portara gate is all that remains of an unfinished temple to Apollo. Commissioned by the island’s 6th-century BC ruler, Lygdamis, the temple — like many ancient ambitions — was abandoned mid-build due to war. Today, only the grand lintel remains, silently watching over Naxoa. Today, the Portara gate is one of the most recognisable and popular landmarks in the Cyclades. Every evening, the crowds make their way across the narrow strip of land to climb the small hill and watch the sun dip behind the gate on its course into the Aegean horizon. Looking back to Naxos is equally beautiful, bathed in the warm amber light of dusk. While beautiful, the reality of the scene in peak season can be quite chaotic; any sense of calm negated by the constant hum of drones and millions of photoshoots occurring. Which is exactly why we recommend visiting at sunrise instead. Yes, you’ll miss the ‘insta shot’ of the sun setting through the frame (which to be honest, will always look better to the naked eye anyway), but in return, you’ll have the site virtually to yourself. It’s a far more peaceful way to experience one of Naxos’ most emblematic sights. THE DETAILS Where | Portara Gate, Naxos SPEND TIME AT THE BEST BEACHES ON NAXOS If there’s one thing Naxos does exceptionally well, it’s its beaches. Take Plaka beach , for example. It’s a long, soft stretch of white sand (a rare sight on the Med!) backed by dunes and dotted with relaxed beach bars. The water is crystal clear, the atmosphere easygoing. At times, it felt more like Southeast Asia than the Cyclades, making us pause and remind ourselves we were still in Europe. But Plaka is only the start. The real beauty of Naxos’ coastline is its variety. Plaka’s endless sands contrast sharply with Hawaii Beach, a rugged shoreline backed by striking red cliffs. Agios Prokopios buzzes with sunbeds and sunburnt holidaymakers, while Agios Georgios, near Chora, is a magnet for windsurfers and paddleboarders (especially at Flisvos Sportclub ), and the untouched beaches to the southeast of the Island feel timeless. There really is a beach for every mood here. We spent over a month exploring almost every shore (read our full Naxos beaches guide here ), but if you’re in a hurry you’ll find snapshot of our favourites below. Note | Naxos beaches are prone to the Meltemi —strong northern winds that sweep through in July and August. Perfect for windsurfers, less ideal for those seeking calm waters. But don’t worry—there are plenty of sheltered spots if you know where to look. PLAKA BEACH Plaka beach is a dream - endless soft, white sand, clear blue sea, upmarket beach bars and relaxed restaurants. Plaka feels a little more refined than Prokopios, but it still maintains a certain unspoiled feeling to it, especially the southeastern side, where farmland still meets the beach. It’s the best of both worlds that makes Plaka beach our favourite on the island. In the morning, you can be all alone, swimming amongst turtles and fish on the southern stretch, and in the afternoon you can sit at upmarket Tortuga, enjoying the finest seafood and cocktails on the island, from your own beachside cabana. Unfortunately, the unspoiled nature of Plaka is likely to change soon, as development threatens to rears its ugly head - but in the meantime, enjoy this beach for what it’s worth. READ MORE | Everything to do on Plaka Beach, Naxos AGIOS PROKOPIOS The most popular beach on Naxos, Prokopios is your quintessential holiday destination beach, filled with beach clubs, sun beds, and water sports. The beach itself is endless, with a wide sandy beach and some of the most gorgeous, turquoise water on Naxos. If your idea is to sit back on a deck chair and read a good book, you’re in luck - the eastern part of the beach has 5+ beach bars with affordable sun beds (€15 - €25 per bed), good food and great service. Our favourite is Kahlua. If you’d like something quieter, head further up the beach you walk (towards the headland), for the more relaxed, chilled area. ALYKO / HAWAII BEACH Set amongst the cedar forest of Alyko in the southeast of the Island, Alyko / Hawaii beach is remote, backed by burnt orange cliffs which make this unique beach one of our favourites on Naxos. There’s no natural shade and no sunbeds (it’s part of the appeal), so make sure you bring something to give you some shade. Also come with your own snacks and beverages as there’s no bar anywhere near. It’s trickier to get to — a 30-minute drive from Chora — however, it’s this remoteness that makes it quieter and untouched than the built-up beaches close to Naxos Town. Close by is the Alyko hotel ruins and open-air street art gallery, which are well worth a look. AGIOS GEORGIOS & MIKRI VIGLA Love windsurfing, kite surfing or wind foiling? Naxos is your place. The summer Meltemi winds make the southwestern side of Naxos ideal for any wind/water-based activity. As a result, the island is well set up for any manner of wind/kite/para sailing activities, especially in Agios Georgios and Mikri Vigla. If you’re already an expert, Mikri Vigla is the best place to enjoy the winds, however, if you’re looking to learn, Agios Georgios (Flisvos Sports Club) and its shallow bay are perfect. EXPLORE THE CUTE VILLAGES OF NAXOS If you’re like us, the charm of other Cycladic islands delights for a while, but leaves you craving something more authentic. Naxos’ historic mountain villages offer the perfect antidote to the hyper-tourism and glossy facades of the more famous neighbouring islands. Here, time slows and true value is found in more simple pursuits: good food, local wine, genuine hospitality, and lingering moments unhurried by a clock. Never did we feel the real ‘Greece’ more than in these villages, and they’re simply a must-visit on Naxos. HALKI Amongst the mountain roads, citrus orchards and ancient olive groves of Naxos’ fertile Tragea region, pretty Halki (Chalkio) exudes Venetian charm — and is the perfect place to wile away a few slow hours in gorgeous surrounds. Once the island’s bustling capital, these days Halki’s fame lies in its slower pace as much as the Vallindros Kitron Distillery and Fish & Olive ceramic house found amongst its neo-Classical buildings and cobbled marble laneways. Most of those laneways eventually lead you to the shaded main square, where a handful of local tavernas invite hungry tummies to savour a delicious, slow meal. Just a short walk out of town amongst the lush olive plantation is the wonderful 11th Century Byzantine Church of Saint George Diasoritis. Halki is best visited in the early-mid morning, before the day’s heat becomes too intense and restaurants stop serving food in the late afternoon. Alternatively, head there after 5 pm. READ MORE | Our guide to Halki, Naxos FILOTI A short drive from Halki brings you to Filoti — a little slice of truly local life. Here, sun-weathered locals gather at the shaded tables lining the main street, catching up on the week’s news over coffee and cigarettes, while farm trucks stacked with Naxian potatoes rumble past on their way to Chora. The mood is unhurried and lived-in; life unfolding as it always has. Wander uphill into the quiet alleyways and you’ll find little more than the crackle of a radio or the occasional procession to the village cathedral. And that’s the appeal of Filoti - to immerse yourself, for however long or short, in Greek rural life. It’s wonderful. Beyond simply being present, we recommend a stroll through Filoti’s laneways to the Tower of Barozzi, an imposing 17th-century tower, and stopping by one of the many restaurants on the main square - our favourite was Ambrosía . Don’t miss the incredibly photogenic produce stall nearby, stacked with fresh fruit and veg Just outside the village, you’ll find the trailheads to Zas Cave , believed to have been continuously inhabited since the Neolithic era, and Mount Zas (guide coming soon) — the highest peak in the Cyclades, with sweeping views across the islands. APEIRANTHOS Our first mistake visiting Apeiranthos was arriving at midday, when the marble streets scorched with white-hot heat. Our second was not staying longer. This gorgeous town, built mostly from marble and marked by its Venetian past, is a must-visit on Naxos. As with all the mountain villages of Naxos, a walk through the hamlet is as if walking through a time warp. Marble paved laneways snake their way through the town, covered by archways, defence towers and walls. Fig trees rise from every available crack, while mules still haul goods up the slopes to elderly residents. To get a sense of the village, just get lost among the alleyways and follow your nose - you’ll eventually end up back where you came from. If you have time to linger, head to the archaeological (which houses over 2,000 exhibits) Natural History, or folklore museum. Or take in the views of the undulating hills towards Mt Zas from one of the very good restaurants. We recommend Taverna Platanos , which serves the best mousaka we tried in Greece, washed down with an agreeable jug of red wine. KORONAS While Apeiranthos, Filoti and Halki get all the attention when it comes to Naxos’ mountain towns, Koronos was actually our favourite of them all. This pretty little town is definitely the most authentic on the island. It’s sleepier, more local, and definitely not used to the attention the other towns get. There’s not necessarily a lot to see here - it’s rather a place to get lost amongst the narrow laneways. The level of English is slightly less, there are fewer tourists wandering about, and if you sit in the church square or Matina and Stavros’ Taverna (more on that below) you’ll get a chance to witness the daily lives of the locals who live here. Koronas also has some of the best views on the island in our opinion, dramatic mountains rising straight out of the sparkling Aegean, and with views over to. TAKE A ROAD TRIP THROUGHOUT THE ISLAND One of our favourite days on Naxos was spent tracing the island’s outer edge by car. As we wound along open roads, through remote villages and empty beaches, it sometimes felt as though the meltemi winds had transported us to a different island entirely. It’s only once you escape Naxos’ well-trodden southwestern reaches that the island’s true scale and wild beauty come into focus: towering peaks, sprawling olive groves and timeworn villages all worth your time. We suggest taking the route north of Chora towards Melanes, where you can visit the ancient Kouros statues and walk amongst the ruins of Fleri", "images":

There are certain places in the world where you arrive, take little more than a few steps and a quick glance around, and already feel right at home. We call them soul places, and the Greek island of Paros is one of them ( Nepal and Sri Lanka are others if you’re curious!). Smack bang in the middle of the Cyclades, 220 islands make up this ancient, windswept, archipelago south of Athens, this charming island made its fortunes in ancient times through its famed Parian marble and abundant fertile lands. It wooed us with those ubiquitous Greek island elements: feta-cubed villages, endless marmalade sunsets, sun-drenched hilltop towns, pretty laneways made for slow meanders, endless golden beaches and hidden coves, lazy days and long nights filled with delicious food (and booze), and the gorgeous old fishing harbour of Naoussa , that twinkles with fairy lights at dusk while the boats bob gently in the water. The starting point is vibrant Parikia , a historic port that’s the beating heart of Paros Island. However, it’s elegant Naoussa where you should spend most of your time, enjoying its arcaded laneways, exceptional restaurants and bars, and close-by beaches. Nestled in the undulating hills is Lefkes , the former capital and quite possibly the most beautiful village in Greece, and the equally gorgeous Prodromos and Marpissa. All of this, ringed by some of the best beaches in Greece. Paros, simply, is food for the soul. Recently featured on Netlix’s hit TV show, One Day (which incidentally, is our fave TV show ever), Paros Island is set to explode this summer. So here are our things to do in Paros Island, covering the best of the island, personally curated by us after a wonderful three weeks spent on the Island. LOVE OUR PHOTOS? Edit like us with our European Summers Preset Packs , and mobile video filters , inspired by the warm hues and vibes of summers spent in Europe PAROS TRAVEL GUIDE OVERVIEW TOP THINGS TO SEE | Naoussa Harbour, Parikia, Lefkes Village, Paros beaches, Petra Farm WHERE TO STAY | Cove Paros , Parīlio Design Hotel , or Svoronos BEST TIME TO VISIT | May, September CURRENCY| Euro HOW TO GET AROUND | Car rental , Bus, Scooter/ATV THINGS TO DO ON PAROS ISLAND DISCOVER THE WONDERS OF NAOUSSA Stepping into the quaint fishing village of Naoussa for the first time, it’s easy to lose your breath (pssst - you can read our Naoussa guide here ). Postcard-perfect in every way, wooden boats bob in the harbour and octopus dry like garlands in the sun, bougainvillaea straddles the walls of storied, cobbled laneways, while the elegant and well-heeled glide along the candle-lit harbour as the afternoon sun descends. On an evening, it’s even more fabled, as fairy lights twinkle and the smell of grilled seafood gently wafts through the air. The harbour itself is gorgeous; an array of small Cycladic fishing boats nestled tightly together, set against a backdrop of Venetian mansions and Orthodox churches, while the town plays host to some of the most picturesque corners we found in Greece. In short, Naoussa is magical and without a doubt, the prettiest village in the Cycladic Islands, and worth a lot of your time - here’s what to see and do : WALK THE OLD TOWN Naoussa is an unbelievably pretty town, full of narrow, cobbled laneways, ancient archways and charming corners. The heart of the old town is filled with restaurants, bars, boutiques and souvenir stores, and while this might detract from many other places around the world, it somehow works here. It’s best to explore at sunset when the sun illuminates the town in marmalade orange, and the cocktails begin to be served (more on that below). If you’re a photographer like us, exploring at sunrise is the better option to avoid the crowds! KASTELLI VENETIAN FORTRESS The walls of the Naoussa harbour are bookended by the crumbling 15th-century Venetian fortress, which is worth a quick visit, if not for the history, then for the incredible views back towards the town. Built to defend the Naoussa from pirate attacks (there’s a reason why the name Barbarossa is all over the town), the walls and tower are interesting enough to explore, showcasing what life may have been like all those years ago. Just be careful when the waves are high - the walk across the breakwater is quite narrow. GO SHOPPING After arriving from Mykonos, where a simple sarong will set you back €100, the array of affordable, exceptional boutiques that line the alleyways of Naoussa was a welcome surprise. Simply, if you wish to shop on the Greek Islands, this is the place to do it. There are many wonderful shops, selling bespoke pieces through to well-known brands, as well as souvenir shops that aren’t filled with plastic garbage, but with locally made ceramics and jewellery. BOOK | See the best of Naoussa with this organised Paros day tour - just sit back, relax and see all the major attractions with ease! READ MORE | Our complete guide to Naoussa, Paros SPEND TIME AT PAROS ISLANDS BEST BEACHES Paros Island, like neighbouring Naxos, has some of the best beaches in all of Greece. There’s a wonderful diversity to Paros’ beaches - in the north and east, you’ll find calm coves and relaxed beach bars; in the undeveloped south and west, long stretches of white sand, and a more rugged feel. Regardless, hours spent by the water are essential here on Paros, and during our time on the island, we spent many days exploring all corners, sampling each stretch of sand and stone in search of the perfect cove to place our towels and parasols. It can be a little overwhelming to choose which Paros beach you should spend your time at, so we’ve listed our favourites below: MINI SANTA MARIA BEACH Mini Santa Maria beach is one of the more beautiful and clear beaches in the Paros, and we’d almost go as far as saying the whole of the Cyclades, so it makes sense that the beach scene from the Netflix series ‘One Day’ was filmed here. Situated 10 minutes from Naoussa in the northeast of the Island, mini Santa Maria is set amongst a series of calm coves, hidden away from the hustle of Paros. It’s super laidback here, and. the perfect place to spend the whole day by the sea. Typically in the Mediterranean, the beach is mostly taken up by beach beds (from €20), serviced by the surrounding tavernas, so those wanting a ‘free’ spot to lay their towel might struggle a little here. However, there is a small section to the right of the beach to lay your towel and bathe. Located close by is our favourite taverna on the island, Katsunas , where we spent many afternoons eating delicious Greek food. KOLYMBITHRES Picturesque Kolymbithres is set amongst a unique, moon-esque landscape west of Naoussa. We spent many an idyllic afternoon basking in a golden haze, dozing on the sloped rocks while kids jumped off the jetty in the distance and tourists wandered through the rocks and coves. Every now and then we’d slip into the water and submerge, letting the cool waters wash away the heat before rinsing and repeating. As with most Greek beaches, there are tavernas nearby and a couple of beach clubs if you wish to relax in comfort. For those wishing to just bathe, you’ll need to get there early to snap up your piece of sand/rock. FARAGAS Located in the wild southern part of Paros is Faragas Beach, Mark’s favourite beach on the Island. We visited before the season had got into swing, and had the beach almost to ourselves. We swam for hours and watched the golden sunset from the water. We revisited as the season started, and spent a day at the slightly underwhelming Faragas Beach Club . The beach was mostly taken up by sunbeds and parasols, however, it didn’t diminish too much the beauty of the location. Although it’s a bit trek to get to, the refreshing blue waters and quiet beauty make it completely worthwhile. KALOGEROS BEACH Fringed by ochre-coloured cliffs, Kalogeros is probably the most unique beach on Paros. Raw, rugged, and beautiful, Kalogeros isn’t your typical spend all day lounging on the sun-type beach, rather its popularity is derived from its clay mud, which when wet, acts as the perfect exfoliant and body paint, or in our case, mud throwing competition. To the right of the beach is where you’ll find the clay - simply pop some in your hands, wet it and rub it over your body. Then, let the sun do its thing, drying out the clay, before washing it off in crystal clear waters. One word of warning though - Kalogeros’ position to the south of the island means it is susceptible to large waves from passing ferries - so place valuables up high, and just keep your wits about you when a ferry passes by! KEEP READING | These are the best beaches on Paros EXPLORE LEFKES AND THE VILLAGES OF PAROS ISLAND Surrounded by olive groves and pine forests in verdant hills of interior Paros, Lefkes is a quintessentially historic Cycladic village boasting narrow stone laneways, stunning traditional and neo-classical architecture, delicious tavernas, friendly locals, and that pleasant vibe found only in Greece. Built in the 17th century as a protected enclave from the rampant piracy that plagued the Mediterranean waters during this period, Lefkes was, at one point, the capital of Paros. This history is evident today in its grand (and somewhat dilapidated) old buildings. Now though, it’s a popular day trip for those wanting to visit a truly traditional Greek village or experience the dreamy scenes from ‘One Day’ (yes, part of the Greek Island episode was filmed in the heart of Lekfes), and this tourism boom has seen prosperity return to the village and an influx in inhabitants keen to regenerate Lefkes to its former glory. We visited Lefkes on four separate occasions, enamoured by its bougainvillaea-lined squares, photographic alleys, and sense of calm - time really stands still here, and you can’t help but embrace it. Popular things to do include walking the ancient Byzantine Road (more on that below), strolling the outrageously beautiful alleys, sipping coffee under the bougainvillaea at Kafénion, enjoying a Greek pastry or four at the historical Stratis bakery, stepping inside the grand Triada church, or simply admiring the view over a delicious meal at Chrisoula . Further down the road (or path if you’re walking the Byzantine Road)are a few other Paros villages that we feel are worth your time. Prodromos , with its jasmine and honeysuckle-lined streets, and the delicious Kallitechniko cafe, is worth a stop for an hour or two, while pretty Marpissa, with its insta-famous pink door and timeless streets, is another must-see on Paros. THE DETAILS Where | Lefkes Village, Paros Tips | Visit in the early morning, or late afternoon to avoid the heat. Parking is available here BOOK | See Lefkes with this organised Paros day tour - just sit back, relax and see all the major attractions with ease! RELATED | Our in-depth guide to Lefkes Paros SAMPLE INCREDIBLE WINE AT MORAITIS WINERY The story of Moraitis Winery can be traced back to the Cycladic era (3,200 - 2,000 BC) when Aegean winemaking really commenced and Paros was at the epicentre of wine production. Founded in 1910, Moraitis has championed the indigenous varieties from those early Cycladic times: Monemvasia (Malvasia), Mandilaria, Aidani Black, Vaftra and Karampraimi - making the wine on Paros so wonderfully unique. The winery, located just outside Naoussa , has since been passed from generation to generation, and the family now owns 18,000 m2 of organic vineyards in selected areas of the island. So a lazy afternoon spent sampling their incredible wines is one of the best things to do on Paros. The cellar door itself is typically Cycladic in style, and a wine tasting session is set on the shaded terrace, under the grapevines, bougainvillaea and summer breeze. The tasting flights comprise three wines - a white, Rosé, and red variety, which can be selected to suit your taste from their large range of wines and are accompanied by a selection of cheese, tomatoes and bread. For Mark, the famous Malvasia was the pick of the wines - crisp, dry and wonderful for the afternoon, while Mim adored the Rosé. Beyond the wine tasting, there are winery tours available, as well as a full-scale restaurant serving traditional Cycladic cuisine. THE DETAILS Where | Moraitis Winery, Paros Opening Hours | Monday – Saturday: 12 pm – 8 pm Cost | Wine tasting starts at €16 per person EXPLORE PARIKIA, THE CAPITAL OF PAROS ISLAND When compared to the effortless calm and beauty of Naoussa, Parikia feels jarring, like the chaos Athens. However, spend time strolling the whitewashed streets and historic laneways and you’ll begin to realise that Parikia has its own charm (read our guide to Parikia here ). The Islands’ historic capital is nestled on a small hill overlooking the Port, and the old town is filled with cobbled laneways, old churches, shops, restaurants and the historic Frankish Castle. It’s also the epicentre of life and commerce on Paros; it’s here where locals do go about their daily lives, so the town has a far more raw feel to it. The town caters not only for tourists, but for locals too, so prices are cheaper, and you can find just about anything you need on the streets. While we wouldn’t spend any longer than a day exploring the town, it is worth your time, especially for the strong culinary scene, and for the somewhat cheaper, yet equally cool sunset bars which line the coast just south of the port. Some of the best things to do in Parikia include: Frankish Castle | Built in 1260 AD, the Frankish Castle incorporates many historical structures into the castle walls, making a stroll through this part of Parikia a must. It also offers panoramic views over Paros harbour Old Market Street | Home to cute laneways, historic churches, excellent boutiques, and traditional souvenirs Paros Archaeological Museum | A cheap, cheerful archaeological museum showcasing ancient artefacts from Paros’ rich history. At €2 per person, it’s worth a look And here’s where to eat and drink in Parikia: Hops and Colors | Super cool craft beer bar, different from anything else on the Island Cafe Symposium Paros | One of the prettiest cafes in all of Paros, serving exceptional coffee and delicious brunch Distrato Cafe Bistrot | Situated in a beautiful shaded square, Distrato is a hip cafe serving delicious food and coffee Cuore Rosso | Authentic pizza in a beautiful hidden courtyard Bountaraki | Genuine, delicious Greek cuisine. Get the Sea Bream and Watermelon Salad. BOOK | See the best of Parikia with this organised Paros day tour - just sit back, relax and see all the major attractions with ease! READ MORE | Our complete guide to Parikia Paros STEP INSIDE THE HISTORIC PANAGIA EKATONTAPILIANI CHURCH Parikia’s main attraction is its storied ‘Church of 100 Doors’, Ekatontapiliani. An essential thing to do on Paros, this stunning Byzantine-era stone church is situated in the heart of Parikia and is one of the oldest and most important Christian relics in Greece. The story of the church is fabled - St. Helena, mother of Constantine the Great, stopped at a chapel at this very site on Paros on her way to the Holy Land, and vowed to build a church there if she found the True Cross. Find the True Cross she did, and after her death, her son began to build the basilica, a grand structure filled with arches and domes. What you see now is that very church, which in turn sits atop an ancient Grecian temple dedicated to Aphrodite, whose pillars you can see through the glass floor below. The centrepiece of the church is the marble screen that sits in front of the altar, which is inlaid with gold and silver icons, including an intricately carved Madonna. Instead of the standard frescoes, the walls are instead filled with beautiful stone masonry, minimalistic and humble. It’s wonderful to witness, even for those like us who have zero religious affiliation. THE DETAILS Where | Panagia Ekatontapiliani, Parikia Cost | Free Opening Hours | Daily: 7 am - 9 pm Tips | Act respectably, and remember to cover shoulders and knees HIKE THE BYZANTINE PATH The aromatic scent of lavender hangs on the light sea breeze as we walk the historic Byzantine trail between Lefkes and Prodromos. Even in the scorching midday sun, we take our time, enjoying the sweeping views down over Paros’ quaint villages to the imposing mountains of Naxos in the distance. It’s a simple kind of beauty. We pass endless olive groves, over intricate stone bridges, and collapsing stone brick walls, stopping every so often to take photos of the alluring countryside. As the sun starts to make us somewhat weary, we arrive in pretty Prodromos, a quiet town that’s even quieter as locals retreat indoors to escape the searing heat. We collapse at Kallitechniko, the bougainvillaea-covered taverna in the centre of town, slamming down a beer each before diving into a local bean dip and saganaki. Two hours later, relaxed and content, we’re ready to continue our walk. We pass through the beautiful back streets of Prodromos, before meandering through farmland and into the delightful town of Marpissa, walking the endless cobbled streets before ending our hike with a coke and a bus back to Lefkes. Honestly, despite the heat and rolled ankles from the somewhat slippery marble, this hike was one of our favourite things to do on Paros, revealing a side to the Island that not many would see, nor enjoy. To do the hike yourself, we suggest starting in Lefkes (the starting point can be hard to find, so we’ve linked it here ). The easy 3.5 km hike follows the historic 1,000-year-old road linking the ancient towns of Lefkes and Prodromos, and onto Marpissa (if you wish). Connected by bus every hour (€2 euros from Marpissa back to Lefkes, leaves from Windmills ), we recommend commencing the hike early in Lefkes and following the road down into the lower villages. We highly recommend doing the hike in walking shoes, and bringing a hat, sunscreen, and lots of water. THE DETAILS Where | Byzantine Road, Lefkes Cost | Free Tips | Pack water, sunscreen, and a hat. Wear proper shoes EXPLORE PAROS ISLAND FROM THE SEA While Paros’ beaches are incredible, seeing the Island and some of the Lesser Cycladic Islands from the water is heavenly. There’s literally nothing better than spending the day jumping off the back of a catamaran into the turquoise Aegean Sea, then repeating this many times throughout the day, only stopping for food and beer. Off Paros and the Lesser Cycladic islands, sailing couldn’t be better, with the area being blessed with an incredible coastline full of famous beaches, hidden coves and hard-to-get-to isles; exploring the coastline of Paros and the Lesser Cyclades by catamaran is something you absolutely must do. There is a range of luxurious catamaran operators who explore the secluded beaches and coves that only in the know locals can find. We recommend this day tour , which departs from Piso Livadi port early in the morning to make the most of the day. The catamaran is super spacious and comfortable, with shaded lounges and large deck areas for sunbathing and relaxation (book here ). Depending on the weather, the tour sets sail towards Iraklia, stopping at various points to swim or snorkel, including at one WWII plane wreck. Then, it’s on to the islands of Schinoussa or Koufonisia, where after a swim in the delightful turquoise waters, lunch is served. After lunch, there’s more time to swim before heading to Antiparos and Despotiko, before returning back to Paros. On top of snorkelling equipment, there’s a delicious array of local Parian food provided, as well as beer, wine, raki and other drinks. We honestly think this is one of the best things to do on Paros, and we recomme", "images":

{"url": "https://www.thecommonwanderer.com/blog/parikia-to-naoussa-paros", "title": "How To Get From Parikia To Naoussa, Paros: Bus, Car or Taxi | The Common Wanderer", "publish_date": "Jul 1", "text": "How To Get From Parikia To Naoussa (and back): Paros Island Greece Europe Jul 1 Written By The Common Wanderer A complete guide on how to get from Parikia to Naoussa (and back), including three main transport options. If you’re planning to visit Paros Island, chances are you’ll want to get from Parikia to Naoussa , be it when you arrive, or during your trip. For many, including us, Naoussa was the highlight of our trip to Paros. The picturesque harbour and the myriad of laneways play host to some of the best restaurants, bars and shops in all of the Cyclades. So, regardless of how long you plan to spend on Paros, you’ll need to visit Naoussa at some point. Good, up-to-date information on how to get from Parikia to Naoussa can be a little hard to find (at least we found it that way), so we’ve put together this guide to help you make the journey as simple as possible. Fortunately, getting from Parikia to Naoussa (and back) is not hard at all, and this guide shows you how. LOVE OUR PHOTOS? Edit like us with our European Summers Preset Packs , and mobile video filters , inspired by the warm hues and vibes of summers spent in Europe HOW TO GET FROM PARIKIA TO NAOUSSA BEST OPTION | Public bus MOST COMFORTABLE OPTION | Car rental LUXURY | Private transfer CHEAPEST OPTION | Public bus PARIKIA TO NAOUSSA | THE TRANSPORT OPTIONS There are a number of easy, cheap and efficient ways to get to Naoussa from Parikia, although which one you should opt for depends on how long you plan to visit, and whether you’re planning to explore the rest of Paros or relax in the town. We’ve listed the top options below, based on our experiences visiting Paros in the shoulder season and peak season. OPTION #1 | THE LOCAL BUS To get to Naoussa from Parikia, we suggest using the cheapest and potentially easiest option: the local bus. See the Paros bus timetable here Due to the popularity of the route between Parikia Port and Naoussa, there are multiple buses every hour or so (depending on the season), and departure times align with ferry arrival times. It gets busy (more on that below), but trust us, you’ll get a bus! The bus terminal in Parikia can be found to the right of the ferry terminal , making it an easy transfer from the Port to Naoussa, while the Naoussa bus terminal is located a short walk from the town centre. Tickets between major hubs, including Naoussa, cost around €2 (the most we paid was €2.50 for a ticket). Tickets for the Paros bus service should be purchased before boarding and can be found at bus stations or on the bus (you must pay cash). The buses themselves are decent; they're air-conditioned and comfortable, although in peak season, they fill up seriously quickly, and you may find yourself standing. Buses run frequently, although the timings are sometimes a little limiting when you want to pack lots of Paros's best things to do into a single day. TIP | Buses to Naoussa fill up extremely quickly, especially when you arrive via ferry. For this reason, we suggest trying to be one of the first people off the ferry (a tough ask, we know!) and making your way to the bus station immediately. Once you’ve purchased a ticket, wait as close to the departing bus as possible, and if you have to, push to get onto the bus (we’d never usually condone this, but it’s a jungle out there). There will be several buses to meet the ferry, so don’t stress if you miss one. Alternatively, head to one of the promenade cafes in Parikia and wait for the bus station to quiet down, before taking the next available bus. OPTION #2 | BY CAR The easiest and most comfortable way to get from Parikia to Naoussa is via car - be it your own, or via taxi. Fortunately, the route is super simple, with one main road connecting the town towns. Parikia does get extremely busy in the summer, especially around the Port, promenade, and windmill roundabout in the centre of town. If you have your own car and are arriving by ferry, there’s little you can do to avoid this, bar waiting for the traffic to start moving. If you’re picking up a car rental on Paros (more on car rental below), this may mean you avoid the traffic while you’re ‘checking in’. RENTING A CAR ON PAROS Normally, we wouldn’t advocate hiring a car when visiting a Greek island, but Paros is relatively large, and if you have your own set of wheels, especially an air-conditioned set, it will make your life so much easier and allow you to see all the best things to do on Paros . Compared to other Greek Islands such as Santorini, Car rental on Paros is quite affordable, especially during the shoulder seasons, but we highly recommend booking in advance! Expect to pay around €25 - €50 per day for car rental on Paros. If you’re looking to stay in the centre of Naoussa, we recommend against car rental, mostly due to parking issues, and the insane levels of traffic in July and August. To get from Parikia to Naoussa, follow this map. The drive should take between 15 and 30 minutes, depending on traffic. TIP | We highly recommend booking a car before arriving on Paros, as there is limited supply (it’s an island after all!) and cars book out very quickly in summer. BOOK | Search and book car rental on Paros TAXI FROM PARIKIA TO PAROS Due to the easier and more affordable options, we never used a taxi on Paros, however, they do service the route between Parikia and Naoussa, and can be booked in advance for pick up and drop off. It should take between 15 - 30 mins depending on the traffic, and the cost of a taxi will range between €15 - €50 depending on how many passengers, and the traffic. Radio Taxi Paros are your best option and be contacted on this number - +30 22850 22444. Time | 15 - 30 minutes Price | €15 - €50 OPTION #3 | SCOOTER OR ATV For those on a budget, hiring an ATV or scooter might be a better option to explore Paros. ATV’s and scooters afford great flexibility and freedom, and for those looking to stay fairly central to Naoussa, and explore some of the closer beaches such as Kolymbitheres and Santa Maria, an ATV or scooter is perfect and allows you to find a parking space during the peak months (a seriously underrated feature!). However, the comfort levels are just not there on an ATV - so if you’re planning to explore more of Paros, we’d recommend a car, regardless of your budget. Also, if you’re arriving with a heap of stuff, transporting things via ATV/scooter can be a tough ask (although for the Balinese, it’s easy!), so it might be an option to explore the island, rather than getting from Parikia to Naoussa. Note that to rent a scooter in Greece you'll need to show proof of a motorbike license. We rented our ATV from Spanopoulos Car Rental , which was one of the better rental agencies we came across in Greece. ESSENTIAL TRAVEL INFORMATION WHERE IS NAOUSSA? The quaint fishing village of Naoussa (otherwise known as Naousa) is located to the northeast of Paros Island, in the Cycladic Archipelago, Greece. The town itself is 10km from the Island’s capital, Parikia. Parikia is the main port of Paros Island, and where all arrivals start their adventures. Below is a map detailing Naoussa in relation to Parikia (labelled Paros on the map). ACCOMMODATION ON PAROS Paros has some of the most beautiful hotels and villas in the Cycladic Islands, so to help you choose the right place for your budget, we’ve written a complete guide about where to stay on Paros , as well as the best hotels in Naoussa .

Stepping into the quaint fishing village of Naoussa for the first time, it’s easy to lose your breath. Postcard-perfect in every way, wooden boats bob in the harbour and octopuses dry like garlands in the sun, bougainvillaea straddles the walls of storied, cobbled laneways, while the elegant and well-heeled glide along the candle-lit harbour as the afternoon sun descends. On an evening, it’s even more fabled, as fairy lights twinkle and the smell of grilled seafood gently wafts through the air. The harbour itself is gorgeous; an array of small Cycladic fishing boats nestled tightly together, set against a backdrop of Venetian mansions and Orthodox churches, while the town plays host to some of the most picturesque corners we found in Greece . The town though has so much more to offer than its harbour. The myriad of laneways plays host to some of the best restaurants, bars and shops in all of the Cyclades, while the sunsets are sacrosanct here. There are amazing beaches close by, and a decent amount of history for those looking. In short, Naoussa is magical and without a doubt, the prettiest village in the Cycladic Islands, and one of the best things to do in Paros . This guide showcases the very best of Naoussa, from two people who spent a LOT of time here. From what to see and do, and where to stay (you absolutely must book in advance here!), to the best restaurants and bars to enjoy your evenings, our Naoussa guide has everything you’re looking for. Enjoy this hamlet, and make sure you slow down and take it all in, for magic floats on the gentle breeze in this town. LOVE OUR PHOTOS?

The heart of the old town is filled with restaurants, bars, boutiques and souvenir stores, and while this might detract from many other places around the world, it somehow works here. To properly sample the best of the town, we highly recommend getting lost - starting right in the centre, at St. John’s Church. Walk the maze-like laneways that fan out from here, and you can’t go too far wrong. It’s quietest during the day when everyone’s scampered off to the beach for the day, and bursts to life around 5-6 pm until the wee hours of the morning. But it’s best at sunset when the sun illuminates the town in marmalade orange, and the cocktails begin to be served (more on that below). If you’re a photographer like us, exploring at sunrise is the better option to avoid the crowds! WATCH A FAMOUS NAOUSSA SUNSET On Paros , the sunsets are breathtaking. Seriously. And the best place to watch the sunset is by Naoussa Harbour. Each day, the harbour is bathed in golden light and people from all over descend on the myriad of top-class bars to watch the show. Not only is the harbour achingly beautiful, but so too is the visual spectacle as the sun dips behind the mountains in the west. Best enjoyed with a cocktail, of course. In many ways, the sunset signifies the start of a new part of the day in Naoussa - one of the long dinners, wine, cocktails and maybe a boogie. We suggest one of the following bars: Agosta Come Back Bar Methystra Bar Karnagio So If you’re up for a bit of glitz and glamour, watching the sunset from Naoussa harbour is one of the best things to do in Paros . SAMPLE INCREDIBLE WINE AT MORAITIS WINERY As if Naoussa wasn’t perfect enough, just a short walk from the centre of town lies Moraitis Winery, Paros’ premier winemaker and maybe the best place to spend a lazy afternoon. Founded in 1910, Moraitis has championed the indigenous varieties from early Cycladic times: Monemvasia (Malvasia), Mandilaria, Aidani Black, Vaftra and Karampraimi - making the wine on Paros so wonderfully unique. The winery has since been passed from generation to generation, and the family now owns 18,000 m2 of organic vineyards in selected areas of the island. So a lazy afternoon spent sampling their incredible wines is one of the best things to do on Paros . The wine-tasting session is set on the shaded terrace, under the grapevines, bougainvillaea and summer breeze. There is a range of tasting flights available, we chose the Moraitis sample which comprises three wines - a white, Rosé, and red variety, which can be selected to suit your taste from their large range of wines and is accompanied by a selection of cheese, tomatoes and bread. For Mark, the famous Malvasia was the pick of the wines - crisp, dry and wonderful for the afternoon, while Mim adored the Rosé. Beyond the wine tasting, there are winery tours available, as well as a full-scale restaurant serving traditional Cycladic cuisine. THE DETAILS Where | Moraitis Winery, Paros Opening Hours | Monday – Saturday: 12 pm – 8 pm Cost | Wine tasting starts at €16 per person HIT THE BARS OF NAOUSSA Due to its burgeoning party scene, Paros has been compared to Mykonos, and while we personally would never wish Paros to become like Mykonos (Paros is bloody wonderful, Mykonos not so much), the current nightlife scene is actually quite good, and a lot less obnoxious than its Cycladic counterpart. Here on Paros, there is a range of beach clubs, bars and all-night clubs, but it’s still a far more relaxed vibe here on Paros - people don’t necessarily come here to party, but there’s always the option. Oh, and it’s much more affordable than Mykonos Naoussa, with its array of cool cocktail bars and late-night clubs, is one place to get your party on. COME BACK BAR Nestled right up against the shoreline and inside a beautifully renovated traditional Cycladic building, Comeback bar is one of those places where you sit down for one drink and end up settling in for hours. Which is exactly what we did! The cocktails are great - we settled for a Paros Spritz (€13) which was just perfect as the sunset. While it can get pretty lively once the party really gets started in the late evening hours, it’s a tranquil spot to cosy in the outdoor loungers and enjoy a cocktail during sunset. SANTE COCKTAIL BAR Situated in an achingly cute square under the shade of a gum tree, Sante is an exceptional spot for cocktails, vibes, and unrivalled hospitality. The cocktails are phenomenal, up there with anything you’d find in Athens, and the energy was such that this was where you wanted to be every night. Word of warning though - it gets very, very busy, so plan ahead and make a reservation. I TRIA An excellent bar with a great cocktail menu located in the beating heart of Naoussa. Set on the corner of a busy thoroughfare, I Tria is colourful, relaxing, and has amazingly friendly service from Piero - it feels more like a home than a bar. Cocktails are affordable, the selection of beer strong, and drinks come with sides of chips, nuts and olives, which is a great touch so often missed in Greek bars. KOSMOS BAR A great little bar situated in the heart of Naoussa, serving really good cocktails, and a suitably relaxed atmosphere. Kosmos make specialty cocktails based on the liquor you like (sweet, spicy, etc), so you’re guaranteed to have something that will blow you away every time. Cocktails start at €10. DODO On our final day on Paros, we walked past Dodo at 8:30 am, and the party was still going, which kind of tells you what sort of place this is... Set in the heart of town, Dodo is a bar that wouldn’t look out of place in Southeast Asia - the drinks are cheap, the decor is understated (you sit on the floor!), and the vibe is young, and fun. We tend to think of Dodo as more of a party place than a fine cocktail bar, as many are in and around Naoussa, and that’s kind of its appeal. So if you want a vibe, and a place to drink the night away, head here. KASTELLI VENETIAN FORTRESS The walls of the Naoussa harbour are bookended by the crumbling 15th-century Venetian fortress, which is worth a quick visit, if not for the history, then for the incredible views back towards the town. Built to defend the Naoussa from pirate attacks (there’s a reason why the name Barbarossa is all over the town), the walls and tower are interesting enough to explore, showcasing what life may have been like all those years ago. There are a few exceptional vantage points from here, especially during the golden hours of the day. Just be careful when the waves are high - the walk across the breakwater is quite narrow. THE DETAILS Where | Kastelli Venetian Fortress, Paros VISIT THE IMPOSING AGIOI ANAGYROI CHURCH Dominating the Naoussa skyline is the Holy Church of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary (Agioi Anagyroi), the metropolitan church of the town. Located on a hill overlooking Naoussa bay and the town itself (which is amazing at sunset, by the way!), the church was built by the contributions of the local residents. While it is not historic, it is important, and a visit here is a great way to understand the culture and community of the town. To reach the main entrance of the church, you will have to climb 16 marble steps, however, once inside, you can see its main feature, a small narthex built in the 19th century, which is the main historic attraction. THE DETAILS Where | Agioi Anagyroi, Naoussa Paros GO SHOPPING IN NAOUSSA After arriving from Mykonos, where a simple sarong will set you back €100, the array of affordable, exceptional boutiques that line the alleyways of Naoussa was a welcome surprise. Simply, if you wish to shop on the Greek Islands, this is the place to do it. There are many wonderful shops, selling bespoke pieces through to well-known brands, as well as souvenir shops that aren’t filled with plastic garbage, but with locally made ceramics and jewellery. VISIT NAOUSSA’S BEST BEACHES MINI SANTA MARIA BEACH Mini Santa Maria beach is one of the more beautiful and clear beaches on Paros , and we’d almost go as far as saying the whole of the Cyclades. Situated 10 minutes from Naoussa in the northeast of the Island, mini Santa Maria is set amongst a series of calm coves, hidden away from the hustle of Paros. It’s super laidback here, and. the perfect place to spend the whole day by the sea. Typically in the Mediterranean, the beach is mostly taken up by beach beds (from €20), serviced by the surrounding tavernas, so those wanting a ‘free’ spot to lay their towel might struggle a little here. However, there is a small section to the right of the beach to lay your towel and bathe. Located close by is our favourite taverna on the island, Katsunas, where we spent many afternoons eating delicious Greek food. KOLYMBITHRES Picturesque Kolymbithres is set amongst a unique, moon-esque landscape west of Naoussa. We spent many an idyllic afternoon basking in a golden haze, dozing on the sloped rocks while kids jumped off the jetty in the distance and tourists wandered through the rocks and coves. Every now and then we’d slip into the water and submerge, letting the cool waters wash away the heat before rinsing and repeating. As with most Greek beaches, there are tavernas nearby and a couple of beach clubs if you wish to relax in comfort. For those wishing to just bathe, you’ll need to get there early to snap up your piece of sand/rock. AGIOI ANARGYROI BEACH Situated just outside Naoussa Paros, Agioi Anargyroi is probably the best beach close to town. No, that isn’t saying much, but if you’re after a quick swim close to the town, this is your place. A large, horseshoe-shaped bay, the beach is popular in the summer months and as such, is filled with sunbeds and parasols which fill quickly. Fortunately, due to its secluded nature, it’s perfect for families or those who dislike waves. EAT ALL THE GELATO Being the ice cream enthusiasts that we are (our life motto is “an ice cream a day keeps the doctor away\"), we felt compelled to try the many gelato and ice cream options in Naoussa, and there are a few standouts for our discerning taste buds. NONNA CREMA Perhaps the best gelato on the island, the super cute Nonna Crema makes fresh, homemade gelato in that quintessential Greek-style - thick, creamy, and smooth (we definitely feel gelato is heavier in Greece than in Italy!). Their chocolate and salted caramel are a taste sensation, as was the pomegranate pistachio. However, you can’t go wrong with just about any flavour on offer. The only problem is they’re open from 6 pm - Midnight, which means midday ice cream is out of the question. 32 AGOSTO At 32 Agosto, their motto is “ice cream makes everything better”, and this is a sentiment we can get behind. This island institution serves up gelato and ice pops, which are the winner here - basically, you can choose your flavour of ice pop, which is 100% handmade and natural, then dip it in the chocolate of your choice, before adding another topping (more chocolate, nuts, fruits etc.). It’s novel, cheap, and absolutely delicious. There are also a huge array of vegan options. Our favourite was the watermelon, dipped in white chocolate, and served with chocolate flakes - a winning combination if there ever was one! WHERE TO EAT AND DRINK IN NAOUSSA | BEST NAOUSSA RESTAURANTS BRUNCH AT ALMOND LIVING WELL, NAOUSSA The time we spent at Almond Living Well in Naoussa (almost every day we spent on the Island) still lives rent-free in our heads - it was the most unexpected and wonderful surprise on the Island, which we admit is weird when you consider everything that Paros has to offer. But from the moment we walked into this place, we fell in love - with the food, the coffee, and most of all, the owners. The cafe itself has lots of Bali or Tulum vibes; think open and airy, with concrete floors and a built-in couch wall, swaying raffia roof and a decorated pink wall just made for Instagram. However, the food was the standout, though. It was fresh, healthy, and mouthwateringly good, with plenty of vegan and veggie options available, which is something of a rarity in the islands too. We tried just about everything on the menu, so we can highly recommend the eggs florentine, the smashed avocado with poached eggs, the almond butter pancakes (maybe the best we’ve ever had!), and the decadent carrot cake. While Almond also does a dinner service, we didn’t get a chance to visit - but having read the reviews, it sounds just as exceptional. For drinks, the coffee is second the none on the Island (and maybe even in Europe!) - you’d expect that when Stefano, the owner, made his own bespoke coffee machine - it was rich and creamy, just how coffee should be. The smoothies were also delicious. THE DETAILS Where | Almond Living Well Paros, Naoussa Opening Hours | 9 am - 10 pm daily OUR FAVOURITE NAOUSSA RESTAURANTS With an incredible selection of restaurants in Naoussa, you won’t be short of culinary options. After spending three weeks based in the town, we’ve eaten at a lot of restaurants, and these are some of our favourites: MARIO You simply can’t leave Paros without dining under the stars in Naoussa harbour. And Mario might just be the best restaurant in the harbour. The vibe here is something else, especially from around 8:30 pm as the throngs descend on the Port, and the fairy lights begin to twinkle. Start with a glass of wine, and enjoy the atmosphere before diving into your meal. The food, while not the best you’ll find on the Island, is good - we recommend the fresh seafood pasta or any seafood options for that matter. Be warned though, it’s not cheap here, so be prepared to pay for the wonderful experience. SOSO Soso is known for its delicious, high-quality food at an affordable price. Nestled in the backstreets away from the buzzing harbour, Soso is a more tranquil, family affair than other, more high profile restaurants in the town. Every plate brings a combination of traditional Greek food with a touch of innovation, and we highly recommend the homemade moussaka, which is potentially the best on the Island. For starters, the smoked salmon is a winner. Like everywhere in town, don’t forget to book in advance! MARMITTA The large staircase descending from the road into town only provides a small window into the Marmitta’s true beauty; round the last step and you’ll see a glimmering candlelit courtyard open out before you like a secret hidden garden. While there’s a standard selection of Greek dishes on the menu, we loved the vast array of vegetarian options and took full advantage of them. We recommend the lentil balls with tomato sauce, Parian chickpeas with leek chips, and potato croquettes. Dinner here would be perfect for a special occasion or splurge meal during your travels. YEMENI WINE RESTAURANT Located right in the heart of Naoussa, Paros is Yemeni Wine bar. Featuring gourmet Greek cuisine with a farm to table approach, and an extensive wine range, Yemeni is one of the best restaurants in town. If you’re a foodie, you’ll love it here, with a modern twist on Greek cooking resulting in a delicious array of dishes including dolmades, zucchini flowers, aubergine salad, calamari couscous, grilled aubergine with halloumi, pumpkin risotto, and grilled octopus. Our faves though, were the buffala and mushroom starter, the dolmades (omg we love these), and the pumpkin risotto. It’s worth noting that Yemeni also have a sommelier to help you choose the right wine bottle for your dinner. Due to its location and popularity, you’ll need to book in advance STATHEROS RESTAURANT Located right on the beach just outside of the town centre, Statheros is what dreams are made of. But the location isn’t the only thing the restaurant has going for it - the dishes, mostly seafood, are exceptional. The cheese pie is the perfect starter, followed by the orzo with shrimp. The octopus with honeyed onions was also a delight. Overall, with wonderfully friendly staff, an amazing location (especially at sunset) and delicious food, Statheros is highly recommended. PASTELLO RISTORANTE ITALIANO We stumbled upon Pastello when we craved something different to Greek cuisine, and we were pleasantly surprised with how good the pizza was. It wasn’t until we spoke with Christina, the owner, did we realise that both she and her husband were from Italy. The restaurant is situated a few minute's walk outside the busy centre of Naoussa, it features a terrace that overlooks the sea, which is the perfect setting for a relaxed, no-frills dinner. While the menu isn’t extensive, the plates are well presented and the pizza, in particular, is exceptional. And it’s super affordable, too. SOUVLAKIA KARGAS We didn’t eat at 5* restaurants every night (no chance our budget could go that far!), so on evenings where we wanted something quick and easy, we’d make our way to Souvlakia Kargas for a healthy (or not so) dose of halloumi gyros. We’re not one for big statements, but this place was definitely in our top two Gyros places in Greece - everything was so fresh and so tasty, we couldn’t help coming back for more. And the host was friendly af. The prices are also super affordable - a simple gyro will set you back around €2.50, which is perfect for those on a budget.

This guide to the best hotels in Naoussa includes a range of accommodation options to suit different styles, budgets, and amenities, based on personal experiences and expert reviews. The elegant fishing village of Naoussa is the perfect base for your Paros Island adventures . Postcard-perfect in every way, the town is filled with a myriad of cobbled laneways that play host to some of the best hotels, restaurants, bars and shops in all of the Cyclades. The harbour itself is equally gorgeous; an array of small fishing boats nestled tightly together, set against a backdrop of Venetian mansions and Orthodox churches. It’s magical. Home to cosy, family-run hotels through to extravagant beachside villas, there are plenty of hotels in Naoussa to suit every style, traveller or budget. In this guide, we’ve curated a selection of the best hotels in Naoussa Paros, based on our personal experiences, and expert reviews, based on location, amenities and budget. Find your perfect Naoussa hotel, and take in all the incredible beauty of Paros Island. LOVE OUR PHOTOS? Edit like us with our European Summers Preset Packs , and mobile video filters , inspired by the warm hues and vibes of summers spent in Europe WHERE TO STAY IN NAOUSSA - BEST HOTELS OUR TOP PICK | Parīlio Design Hotel LUXURY | Cove Paros BEST VALUE | Kalypso boutique hotel BOUTIQUE BEAUTY | Central Boutique Hotel LUXURY NAOUSSA HOTELS PARILIO DESIGN HOTEL Tucked away in the rolling hills west of Naoussa , you’ll find Parīlio , one of Paros’ best luxury resorts. Architecturally designed to embody the laid-back Cycladic cadence of life, the 33 suites give you no choice but to chill out. The minimal design, understated palette and abundance of natural stone are genuinely relaxing – especially if you’re visiting Paros to escape the excess of Mykonos. Parīlio Design Hotel is outfitted with everything you expect in a luxury hotel at this price point: designer furniture, an enormous pool, an on-site spa, a fitness centre, and a restaurant serving modern Greek delicacies. THE DETAILS BOOK| PARILIO DESIGN HOTEL COVE PAROS Newly opened for summer 2021, the 40-room Cove Paros overlooks the golden sands and sparkling water of our favourite beach on Paros, Agioi Anargyroi. Cove was nearly finished when we visited, and since opening, it’s gained a decent reputation among upscale travellers. The location is idyllic, and the rooms and suites are spacious and well-designed. Rada Restaurant will be exquisite if our Naoussa experience is anything to go by. Hot tip: Moraitis Winery nearby is a must-do while on Paros . Book a tasting to learn about Greek wines and sample local snacks. THE DETAILS BOOK | COVE HOTEL SANDAYA LUXURY SUITES Sandaya Luxury Suites in Naoussa are the pinnacle of elegance. With its swooping curves, beaming white walls, and poolside bar, this luxurious hotel provides a refined simplicity that will immediately have you living your best life. The interior design is not pure Cycladic- instead dripping in decadent tones of mocha. Some rooms provide a spectacular view of the sea, whereas others come with a private balcony. A few suites even come with their private hot tub. In addition to that beautiful pool, guests can also enjoy the on-site restaurant, garden, and complimentary à la carte and continental breakfast. Plus, Sandaya Luxury Suites is only 200m away from the stunning Agioi Anargyroi Beach. THE DETAILS BOOK | SANDAYA LUXURY SUITES COSME PAROS You cannot get any closer to a beach in Naoussa. Cosme Paros sits on what we consider the best beach on the island, Agioi Anargyroi. This breathtaking luxury hotel is designed in the traditional Cycladic style: white walls, sharp lines, and accents of blue. Beyond being aesthetically gorgeous, Cosme Paros boasts a tennis court, fitness centre, spa and wellness centre, and an outdoor swimming pool. There is also an on-site restaurant under the helm of renowned Greek chef Yiannis Kioroglou. THE DETAILS BOOK | COSME PAROS MID-RANGE NAOUSSA HOTELS SAINT ANDREA SEASIDE RESORT Like Parīlio, the 56-room Saint Andrea Seaside Resort is a 25-minute walk west of Naoussa in a secluded area surrounded by abundant nature. The rooms and suites are comfortable enough for a relaxing stay. Overall, though, the hotel’s design feels like it will soon belong in a bygone era. But then there’s the hotel’s best feature by far, the pool. With uninterrupted views over an unspoiled bay out to uninhabited islands, it’s undoubtedly one of the best places on Paros to unwind. THE DETAILS BOOK | SAINT ANDREA SEASIDE RESORT CENTRAL BOUTIQUE HOTEL The tidy Central Boutique Hotel in the centre of Naoussa is a great base to explore the surrounding town. Opened in 2021, the sister hotel to the sprawling Naoussa Hills hotel takes an entirely different approach. And it works. The rooms are thoughtfully designed, balancing white and anthracite with pops of vibrant modern art, and the pool is unlikely to get too crowded. If you’re staying in Naoussa to explore Paros and looking for a comfortable, contemporary base, check out Central Boutique Hotel. THE DETAILS BOOK | CENTRAL BOUTIQUE HOTEL ANEMOI RESORT Just outside of the town of Naoussa (1.5km to be precise), you’ll find Anemoi Resort . Here, you can revel in incredible views of the deep blue sea and the surrounding hills. Anemoi Resort has, of course, an outdoor swimming pool, hot tub, sun terrace, and poolside bar. The resort is typical Cycladic, inside and out. Though the exterior is undeniably traditional, the interior design is more contemporary. That being said, you will still find the white walls, grey accents, and rustic wood furniture representative of this region. THE DETAILS BOOK | ANEMOI RESORT PARIAN BOUTIQUE HOTEL Welcome to the Parian Boutique Hotel , perfectly situated within walking distance of three beaches on Paros: Agioi Anargyroi, Piperi, and Siparos. The sea views from this hotel are incredible, especially if you’re lucky enough to get a room overlooking the Aegean. The Parian is a 4-star accommodation in the heart of Naoussa, surrounded by restaurants and close to the famous Moraitis Winery. Architecturally magnificent and containing a large, luxurious pool, the Parian Boutique Hotel is a fantastic choice for travellers with a mid-range budget. THE DETAILS BOOK | PARIAN BOUTIQUE HOTEL MR & MRS SMITH PAROS Located just beyond the heart of Naoussa Town (but still at a very reasonable distance to the beach) lies Mr & Mrs Smith Paros. The building is perfectly whitewashed and there is air conditioning in every room. This hotel in Naoussa features not one, but two glistening pools. After a swim, bask on one of the sun loungers or order some tasty bites from the poolside snack bar. Speaking of food, the on-site restaurant cooks up a delicious selection of American, Greek, and Cycladic dishes for you to savour. THE DETAILS BOOK | MR & MRS SMITH PAROS BUDGET HOTELS IN NAOUSSA BUNGALOWS SVORONOS With the beach on one side and the historic centre of Naoussa on the other, both a few minutes away on foot, Bungalows Svoronos is in a great area. The rooms are simple but comfortable, with kitchenettes and charmingly creaky Cycladic furniture. Some rooms don’t have air conditioning, which could be a problem in the summer months. But what you’ll really love is the history. Svoronos , one of the oldest accommodations in Naoussa, has spent 50 years accumulating a collection of quirky local antiques and growing the bougainvillaea and trees that shade the garden. THE DETAILS BOOK | BUNGALOWS SVORONOS KALYPSO HOTEL & KALYPSO APARTMENTS Naoussa isn’t cheap, which makes the Kalypso properties appealing right off the bat. There are three Kalypso options: a laid-back boutique hotel by the beach, a 14-apartment complex half a kilometre up the road, or sprawling seafront villas by the bay (although the villas are significantly more expensive). Both the hotel and apartments offer single, double or family rooms in classically whitewashed buildings. You’ve got the essential mod-cons like air conditioning, Wi-Fi and refrigerators, plus kitchenettes in the apartments, and private balconies where you can enjoy a glass of Greek wine and watch the lazy bay. THE DETAILS BOOK | KALYPSO HOTEL , KALYPSO APARTMENTS , KALYPSO VILLAS IRINI ROOMS Irini Rooms may not have a pool but it is next door to Piperi Beach. The Venetian Harbour and Castle are also close by and the town isn’t far either! The rooms at this Paros hotel are simple yet pleasant and feature more nautical decor than you’ll find at the higher-end accommodation options. You will have a fridge and electric kettle in your room, and a shared kitchen is available for use. There is air conditioning, however, no complimentary breakfast or parking. THE DETAILS BOOK | IRINI ROOMS APANEMA PAROS Between Agioi Anargyroi and the historic heart of Naoussa is Apanema Paros . It is the highest-rated budget accommodation on this list, and will not leave you wanting anything (besides breakfast and a pool). Rooms are in the typical Cycladic style of whitewashed walls, shades of Naousa blue, and touches of honey-brown wood. Studios and apartments come with a private kitchenette and satellite tv. Apanema has its own olive garden, complete with a chapel and BBQ facilities. THE DETAILS BOOK | APANEMA PAROS RAGOUSSIS ROOMS Ragoussis Sweet Rooms is well situated in the centre of Naoussa, close to the Venetian Harbour and Castle and an abundance of restaurants. The interiors diverge from most of the other hotels on Paros. You’ll find no classic Cycladic design here. Instead, rooms are more modern with pops of red and purple. It might not be a traditional Paros experience, but the price tag is better suited to travellers wandering on a tight budget. The amenities are basic: flat-screen tv and air conditioning. Some rooms offer a view of the city or sea. THE DETAILS BOOK | RAGOUSSIS ROOMS HOW TO GET TO NAOUSSA Naoussa is located in the northeast of Paros, about 10km from Parikia ferry port. There are a few ways to get to Naoussa from Parikia , although which one you should opt for depends on how long you plan to visit, and whether you plan to explore the rest of Paros or relax in the town. We’ve written a complete guide on how to get from Parikia to Naoussa, which you can read here , otherwise here’s a short breakdown below: LOCAL BUS To get to Naoussa, we suggest the cheapest, and potentially easiest option, by local bus. See the Paros bus timetable here The bus terminal in Parikia can be found to the right of the ferry terminal , making it an easy transfer from the Port to Naoussa, while the Naoussa bus terminal is a short walk from the town centre. Tickets between major hubs including Naoussa cost around €1.80 (the most we paid was €2.50 for a ticket). Tickets for the Paros bus service should be purchased prior to boarding and can be found at bus stations, or on the bus (you must pay cash). RENTING A CAR ON PAROS Normally, we wouldn’t advocate hiring a car when visiting a Greek island, but Paros is relatively large, and if you have your own set of wheels, especially an air-conditioned set, it will make your life so much easier and allow you to see all the best things to do on Paros . Car rental on Paros is actually quite affordable, especially during the shoulder seasons, but we highly recommend booking in advance! Expect to pay around €25 - €50 per day for car rental on Paros. BOOK | Search and book Car rental on Paros SCOOTER OR ATV For those on a budget, hiring an ATV or scooter might be a better option to explore Paros. ATV’s and scooters afford great flexibility and freedom for those looking to stay fairly central to Naoussa and explore some of the closer beaches such as Kolymbitheres and Santa Maria. Note that to rent a scooter in Greece you'll need to show proof of a motorbike license. We rented our ATV from Spanopoulos Car Rental , which was one of the better rental agencies we came across in Greece.

Discover the region’s famous hikes, incredible natural attractions, beautiful towns, the best food, and where to stay. Often when we’re bored, lying on the couch after a hard day’s work and an uninspiring episode of Ozark, we play the game, “if you could be anywhere right now, where would it be?” In years past, we both would’ve immediately shouted Nepal , before a more considered, thought-out answer might end in Namibia , Nepal or Sri Lanka . And then we visited the Dolomites , and it forever became the winner of our silly little game. You see, the Dolomites, an alpine pocket in Italy’s northern reaches, are something else; a land of jagged peaks, which thrust upwards from rolling alpine meadows, endless alpine lakes , incredible hiking , quaint medieval towns, luxurious wellness areas of equally luxurious accommodation , and some of the best cuisine anywhere in the world. They’re a place where alpine and Mediterranean traditions collide, where influences from Italy and Austria blend to create a wonderfully welcoming and enchanting destination for travellers (find out more about South Tyrol here ). We’ve now visited the Dolomites many times, and are keen to share with you our favourite things to do in the Dolomites, plus our recommendations on where to stay and eat, how to get around, and more. Who knows, after you visit the Dolomites yourself, they might just become your answer to “if you could be anywhere right now, where would it be?”! LOVE OUR PHOTOS?

Train or bus to Bolzano THE BEST THINGS TO DO IN THE DOLOMITES #1 CONQUER THE BEST HIKES IN THE DOLOMITES The Dolomites are home to some of the very best hikes in the world. In fact, most of our visits to the region have involved multiple epic hikes; waking before dawn to chase burnt orange sunrises from mountain summits, following ancient trails that wind around the rugged Three Peaks, meandering through green woods, alpine meadows, and past turquoise creeks - and of course, enjoying break times at cute little mountain huts. There are plenty of easy day walks (check out our guide to the best hikes in the Dolomites here ) right through to full and multi-day hikes where you stop in Rifugios high in the mountains for alpine food and perhaps a cheeky schnapps, and lots of general fun with others. A couple of our favourite hikes in the Dolomites are: TRE CIME DI LAVAREDO LOOP (DREI ZINNEN) These are the peaks that made the Dolomites famous; three wildly beautiful, postcard-perfect jagged monoliths as iconic to the area as the Eiffel Tower is to Paris that will undoubtedly have you awestruck as they tower above, clouds lingering at their peaks. We’ve been to Tre Cime di Lavaredo (Drei Zinnen) three times now and would go back a million times more, we love it so! The 10km loop from Rifugio Auronzo is a great short day hike for all levels of hiker, while history buffs can spend time exploring the WW1 tunnel systems left behind when these peaks were fiercely fought over in the Great War too. Close by is the incredible Cadini di Misurina viewpoint , which is well worth the extra hike for one of the best views in the Dolomites. LAGO DI SORAPIS HIKE The Dolomites are famous for their crystal clear lakes (hello Lago di Carezza !), but the turquoise hues of Lago di Sorapis are honestly something else (read our complete guide to the hike here ). It's distinctive colour and position in the foothills of the jagged Dolomiti peaks makes it one of the most picturesque in the region, and the 2-hour hike to Lake Sorapis is one of the best things to do in the Dolomites. Commencing from the carpark on Passo Tre Croci (in between Cortina d’Ampezzo and Misurina), the trail ascends pretty steeply through dense pine forests. It does involve some scrambling and metal chains at some points, but the first glimpses of the milky-blue Lago di Sorapis under the imposing Mt. Sorapis are absolutely worth the somewhat challenging journey to get there. HIKE LAGO DI SORAPIS WITH THIS GUIDE VAJOLET TOWERS TRAIL Rising from the rocky Catinaccio group separating South Tyrol from Trentino are the otherworldly peaks of the Vajolet Towers (Italian: Torri del Vajolet ), jagged teeth-like spires that tower over the landscape below. The Torri del Vajolet are already a popular rock climbing spot, but the trail that leads to the Vajolet Towers base makes for an incredible (if not somewhat challenging) day hike in the Dolomites. With the typically dramatic landscapes and scenery Südtirol is well-known for, without the insane crowds you’d find at other hotspots like Tre Cime di Lavaredo , the Vajolet Towers hike is a must-see on any Dolomites itinerary . There are multiple routes you could take to reach these peaks - we’ve covered all of them in our comprehensive guide to hiking to the Vajolet Towers . OUR VAJOLET TOWERS HIKING GUIDE SECEDA RIDGELINE HIKE Seceda peak is a photographer’s dream; it's crazy dramatic and almost always moody with a sheer drop to the valley below. We hiked up on pre-sunrise one morning when the gloomy weather had blanketed the scene with a thick fog. Right as we were about to give up hope that the sunrise would make an appearance, the clouds began to part and the peaks of Seceda and the Fermeda Towers were revealed in all their glory. Worth it? You bloody bet! The views from the top overlook many of the Dolomites most iconic and stunning peaks, including the Sella group, Sassolungo, and Mt. Schlern, as well as the pretty Alpe di Siusi meadow. For photography lovers and outdoor adventurers alike, a sunrise here is not to be missed. READ | We’ve written about our favourite short hikes in the Dolomites; read about them here OUR FAVOURITE DOLOMITES DAY HIKES #2 ADMIRE THE BEST LAKES IN THE DOLOMITES The mountains might be the Dolomites’ most famous and obvious feature, but no alpine region is complete with glacial lakes, and there are so many incredible ones in the Dolomites . Below are some of our absolute favourites, one of which you guys probably know already (it’s kinda famous!): THE STUNNING LAGO DI BRAIES (PRAGSER WILDSEE) The most iconic alpine lake in the Dolomites, Lago di Braies (Pragser Wildsee) is famous the world over for its emerald waters, ubiquitous boathouse, beautiful spruce pines forests and towering limestone peaks. Unsurprisingly, it’s more impressive in 3D, and worthy of a sunrise visit to avoid the crowds and savour the beauty (save for the 100’s of photographers that scramble for the best vantage points, even in the early hours - it’s not known as Lago di Instagram for nothing!). On that, if you do decide to visit, please don’t be one of those people who break into the boatshed (there’s actually a €150 fee to shoot here) or the tied-up boats for their shot. If the crowds get a bit too much, take the picturesque 1-hour walk which follows the shores of the lake and provides picturesque views from almost every angle. THE DETAILS WHERE | Lago di Braies / Pragser Wildsee COST | 30min boat hire: €18, €150 photography fee for the boathouse READ | Our complete Lago di Braies guide Our guide to Lago di Braies THE RAINBOW LAKE OF LAGO DI CAREZZA(KARERSEE) Perhaps our favourite lake in the Dolomites, Lago di Carezza (also known as Karersee in German), and its picture-perfect reflections of the Latemar range, have long made it a popular choice with tourists and photographers alike - and we have to admit that despite its buzz as an ‘insta-worthy’ destination, it really is one of our favourite places in the whole of South Tyrol and the Dolomites. Probably more so than Lago di Braies . The stunning emerald waters of Lago di Carezza are just a short drive from Nova Levante, and are best witnessed in the early morning just prior to sunrise. Watch the sun hit the top of the jagged limestone peaks of the Latemar range, before encasing the valley in a golden glow. Once you’ve witnessed nature doing her thing, take the short 20 min walk around the lake, enjoying the fresh mountain air and misty spruce forests. THE DETAILS COST | Parking is free for the first 15 min, then €1 per hour for each hour after that STAY | Hotel Stella Stern in Nova Levante Other amazing lakes in the area we recommend looking out for are Lago di Sorapis (read our guide here), Lago di Dobbaico, Misurina, Lago d’Antorno, Lago di Landro, Lago Federa (near Croda da Lago) and the pretty little lake of Lago di Fie. READ OUR LAGO DI CAREZZA GUIDE #3 WANDER THE ALPINE MEADOW OF ALPE DI SIUSI Alpe di Siusi is one of those ’too beautiful to be real’ type places, so it’s understandably become an Instagram playground over the last few years. Despite this, it's honestly beautiful and your jaw will be pinned to the green pastures around you as you admire the views here. The largest alpine meadow in Europe is home to iconic views of rolling hills and alpine huts of the Dolomites and is best enjoyed for sunrise before the crowds arrive. We suggest hiking into the meadow and cabins before watching the sunrise behind the mountain peaks in the distance. Our friend and South Tyrolean local @guiligartner suggests hiking to Adler Lodge Alpe or Malga Sanon for the best photography location. You’re not actually allowed to drive into Seiser Alm (read more here ) unless you’re staying in the area or have a local permit (and it’s a whopping €150+ fine if you do!), so we suggest parking at Compatsch and walking into the meadow at your own pace. THE DETAILS Where | Alpe di Siusi, Selva di Val Gardena Stay | If you want to stay in the meadow, we recommend Adler Lodge Alpe Tips | Don’t get fined €150 for driving in - hike into the area instead! Read | Our guide to Alpe di Siusi #4 TAKE A DOLOMITES ROAD TRIP From Australia to Namibia , the Faroe Islands to Slovenia , we’ve taken many road trips around the world, and it’s safe to say a roadie through the Dolomites is right up there as our favourite. The Dolomites are one place you really want to be a passenger (lucky for Mim she doesn’t drive!), and be mesmerised by the jagged peaks, emerald lakes, verdant meadows, and quaint little towns. In fact, if you’re the passenger in these mountains, it’s your duty to shout “pull over” when yet another outrageous view appears. And there are many; we’ve lost count of the number of times we’ve stopped and pulled over, jaw firmly on the floor, and drooled over the views in front of us. Although public transport in the region is exceptional (seriously!), the only way you can really enjoy each and every corner of the Dolomites, with flexibility for spontaneity, is via having your own car. Fortunately, car rental prices are affordable, the roads are exceptional, and the drivers are slightly less… shall we say ‘Italian’, in these parts. After extensively travelling through the Dolomites, we’ve put together a comprehensive Dolomites road trip itinerary for you guys to follow, which you can read here. Our itinerary covers everything from the insta-perfect lakes to the vertiginous rocky peaks, incredible day-hikes to the must-see museums, not forgetting a host of incredible restaurants, and a spot of adrenalin here and there. It’s an easily followed circular loop through some of the region’s most beautiful roads and stunning regional towns, starting and ending in the accessible and wonderfully pretty city of Bolzano. Use our Dolomites road trip guide as your bible, and you’re sure to have the best week of your life. READ OUR DOLOMITES ROAD TRIP #5 DRIVE OVER THE DOLOMITES’ FAMOUS MOUNTAIN PASSES If you’re planning a road trip through the Dolomites (read above!), then you’ll surely want to tackle some of the incredible mountain passes scattered throughout the region. As road trip lovers and mountain fanatics, a high alpine pass gets us giddy with excitement every single time. There’s nothing better than slowly winding your way along an edge-of-your-seat mountain roads and hairpins, encased by large trees and ever-larger mountains, overlooking the slowly shrinking valleys below, with your favourite road trip tunes pumping. And in the Dolomites , there are many incredible mountain passes. Fortunately, the roads are well maintained, so, while the passes can be adrenalin inducing and a little scary at times, you’ll be safe and sound. Driving over a Dolomiti mountain pass is one of the best things to do in the Dolomites, so here are some of our favourites: PASSO GARDENA Of all the Dolomites mountain passes, Passo Gardena is by far the most popular. Connecting the Val Badia and Val Gardena valleys, the pass is not only incredible (especially at sunrise or sunset), but is also a great starting point for a number of incredible hikes and via ferrata, including the wonderful Gran Cir peak. During autumn, the surrounding larches turn a wonderful shade of yellow/orange, making a drive-through here even more delicious. PASSO GIAU Nestled between the Croda da Lago and Cinque Torri, Passo Giau connects Cortina d’Ampezzo with Selva di Cadore, and is perhaps the most beautiful mountain pass in the Dolomites. The 2,236m pass winds through dense larch forests and a high alpine plateau, with spectacular views amongst the surrounding peaks, making it outrageously picturesque. You must stop at the top and take a short walk into the pastures, or alternatively, start a longer hike into the mountains. SELLA PASS The Sella pass winds between the peaks of Sassolungo and the Sella Towers, and is just as beautiful as the others, with slightly less crowds. Best visited during the sunset hours, when the mountains turn that uniquely Dolomites shade of red/orange, before the skies turn purple. Sella Pass is actually just down the road from Passo Gardena, so if you’re looking for a hairpin kinda day, combine both. #6 DEVOUR THE DELICIOUS ALPINE CUISINE If Italy is one of the world’s culinary royals, then South Tyrol has to be the shining star in its crown (our humble opinion, but we’ll own it!). Not only is it the country’s most decorated culinary province (it has 26 Michelin stars shared by 19 restaurants), South Tyrol’s cuisine melds together the very best of Italian food and the hearty alpine influences of Austria and Germany with centuries-old food traditions to create totally unique, mouth-wateringly delicious dishes that soothe the soul. Basically, it’s heavenly alpine cuisine that makes you feel warm and fuzzy inside. We’re talking fresh pasta, cheese straight from the region, the freshest of ingredients, and generous mountain meals that comfort and soothe aching muscles at the end of a long day outside - all accompanied by brilliant local wine, of course! In the Dolomites, there’s a seasonal, farm-to-table approach to food, with a focus on sustainable food sourcing and practice at the heart of almost every meal. Here, produce is often foraged in the woods nearby or sourced from small-scale farms, and you truly get the sense that every dish you eat has been produced in harmony with the surrounding valleys and peaks. What’s more, there are plenty of options for vegetarians (like us), the food here is generally really affordable, and no matter where you eat, it’s consistently good, every. single. time. When you visit, we totally recommend you try these dishes: Cheese dumplings | Bread dumplings mixed with local cheese. They’re delicious, and hearty as hell Schlutzkrapfen | Far more delicious that it’s name sounds, it’s ravioli type dumpling with spinach, ricotta and chives Kaiserschmarrn | A fluffy shredded pancake served with applesauce and cream. Dessert heaven And these are a few essential places to eat in the Dolomites: Alpinn | Serves locally sourced produce with some of the best views from Kronplatz. Alpinn has a local mountain to plate philosophy, and their signature risotto with wild garlic and wood sorrel is to die for. Be sure to have a Mountain Spritz, made only with local ingredients! Oberholz | Located in a architecturally designed mountain hut, Oberholz has a ridiculously good risotto with mushrooms and flowers straight from the mountain Rifugio Ütia Bioch | Rifugio Utia Bioch , located on Piz Sorega, serves fresh South Tyrollean food overlooking Marmalada #7 EXPLORE THE IDYLLIC VAL DI FUNES Val di Funes - a little pocket of heaven in northern Italy that needs to be seen to be believed. Nowhere else we’ve been before has measured up to the serenity and beauty on offer in this valley. Everywhere you look is fairytale-esque, from its two biggest drawcards, the onion-domed churches of St Maddalena and St Johann in Ranui, to the towering peaks of the famed Puez-Odle National Park, Val di Funes is serene, seemingly untouched by the advances of the modern world. Furthermore, the hikes are wonderful, the food exquisite, and the villages charming. Located close to all the major Dolomites entry points, Val di Funes has become increasingly popular amongst visitors to the Dolomites due to Instagram fame, yet has somehow managed to remain peaceful, quiet, and removed from the hubris. That doesn’t mean there’s nothing to do - there’s plenty to keep you busy, but a visit here is more about taking it slow and healing the head and heart. So come here to take that Instagram photo, stay to hike, bike or simply stare in awe of these mountains. You won’t be disappointed. READ MORE | Our complete guide to Val di Funes , including what to see and do + where to stay #8 SPEND THE NIGHT (OR MANY) IN A RIFUGIO Years ago, we stumbled across a photo of the infamous Rifugio Locatelli near Tre Cime di Lavaredo while scrolling Instagram and distinctly remember thinking “we have to stay here”. And it was in that pretty little mountain hut where we spent our first ever night in the Dolomites. It was amazing. We ate hearty alpine food amongst a crowded dining hall, where laughter abound. We slept soundly, window open enjoying the fresh mountain air. And we rose early, just before sunrise, to experience Drei Zinnen at their most majestic. Having enjoyed many a day and night in the teahouses of Nepal, we felt right at home (albeit with a few more home comforts than Nepali teahouses!), enjoying the wonderful confines of these traditional huts. Ubiquitous here in the mountains of the Dolomites, rifugios/alpine huts are a great place to embrace the alpine culture that exists within the region, where you can enjoy hearty food, beer/schnapps, a convivial atmosphere and a decent night’s sleep after a hard days walking. Or, if you arrive early enough, join your fellow hikers on the terrace with a beer and some sun therapy. The majority of rifugios in the Dolomites are privately owned, and need to be booked well in advance online (old school, no booking.com here!). They’re sometimes dirty, sometimes basic, and sometimes rowdy, but always wonderful. Some of our favourite and most picturesque rifiugios are: Rifugio Locatelli | Located in the heart of Tre Cime di Lavaredo, it’s easy to visit and wonderfully authentic Fanes Hütte | Nestled in the Fanes National Park, this pretty hut has very nice rooms and a wonderfully convivial atmosphere Rifugio Vajolet | Located below the Vajolet Towers, this is one of the more picturesque rifugio in the Dolomites. Definitely worth a stay Rifugio Nuvolau | We’ve not stayed here, but this rifugio, perched", "images":

From secluded hideaways to the most popular swimming spots; our guide to the best beaches on Hvar island has you covered. After eight months of living through the coldest, dreariest, and longest winter of our lives in London, all we could dream of was feeling the sun on our grey skin. So, we spontaneously decided to pack up our London life and head to the idyllic Adriatic Island of Hvar (you can check out our best photos of Hvar - but be warned, you'll want to buy a ticket immediately!). An island, we'd heard, that's drenched in 7.7 hours of summer sun per day (!) and surrounded by the clearest turquoise blue waters. We hoped it would be the perfect antidote for our fragile minds and Vitamin D deprived bodies. It turns out that our spontaneous decision was a pretty bloody awesome one. Hvar. Was. The. Dream. For six weeks, we lived by the ocean, spending our weekends exploring the island in search of the best beaches on Hvar - from popular coves where all the tourists come to play to the hidden gems we somehow stumbled upon, but never wanted to leave. We called it research, but it was just a good excuse to be living our best life! After getting to know the beaches on this corner of the Adriatic pretty damn well, we thought we’d put together a guide to the best beaches in Hvar for you guys. So if you’re planning to visit this Adriatic paradise, here is our guide to the best beaches on Hvar, Croatia. LOVE OUR PHOTOS?

BEYOND THE BEACHES | EXPLORING MORE OF HVAR ISLAND After spending six weeks living on the island of Hvar, and got to know it pretty darn well. Not only is it one of the most beautiful places we’ve ever visited, but there’s also an incredible amount of things to do on Hvar Island and in Hvar town , as well as a huge selection of amazing beaches to choose from. Below is a selection of our top posts from the island, which should have all the information you need to have an incredible holiday, including where to stay, what to eat and places to visit.

DUBROVNIK | 10 Essential things to do in Dubrovnik, Croatia 15 STUNNING BEACHES ON HVAR ISLAND | NEAR HVAR TOWN POKONJI DOL BEACH As if lifted from a 70s Bond film, Pokonji Dol is located a short 25 - minute walk from town and is probably the best and most accessible beach to Hvar town . Despite this, we never saw it too busy, which gave it a comfortable, relaxing vibe. The water was the deepest shade of turquoise, inviting you to jump in straight away. The beach itself is pebbly; however, it’s far more comfortable to lie on than others we found, and definitely one of the best beaches in Hvar. Pokonji Dol is flanked by two delightfully authentic restaurants serving the day’s best catch, and ice-cold beers perfect for a sundowner. Sunbeds are available for hire. THE DETAILS What | Pokonji Dol , Hvar MEKICEVICA BEACH A 20-minute walk through the pine forest from Pokonji Dol will take you to Mekićevica beach, a secluded pebble cove fringed by pine forests with not a tourist in sight. If you’re looking to go au natural on Hvar, Mekićevica beach is your best bet - it’s a known FKK beach and is sheltered, stunning, and has many places to shade yourself should the searing sun prove too much. A short walk through the forest will take you to Robinson’s - a secluded restaurant serving fresh, homemade fare. THE DETAILS Where | Mekićevica beach , Pakleni Islands Pack | Towel, sunscreen, water, packed lunch, a good book, cash for food/snacks at Robinsons BONJ BEACH, HVAR TOWN We've got to admit, our favourite beaches on Hvar were out of town, however, our favourite beach near Hvar Town was Bonj beach. Located near Hotel Amfora, about a 10-minute walk west of Hvar town, Bonj Beach is perfect for those wanting to stay close to their accommodation, or indeed the clubs and bars that make Hvar so famous. Bonj beach has a little bit of celeb about it, with the exclusive Bonj Les Bains beach club on the left attracting the global elite, with their private pontoons and enticing sunbeds. Admittedly, our budget didn't stretch far enough to enjoy an afternoon here. Fortunately, those on a budget can still lie on the small pebble beach or swim in the turquoise waters. There are several restaurants and bars that surround the beach, so you'll not be short of food or drink options. THE DETAILS Where | Bonj beach , Hvar DUBOVICA BEACH | HVAR’S BEST BEACHES Dubovica is one of the most picturesque and popular beaches on Hvar Island. Located about 8km east of Hvar Town, the beach is located in a magical, secluded bay with a large pebble beach, surrounded by pine trees and olive groves. It's basically a Mediterranean dream. Under the blue skies, the stunning Adriatic sea shimmers, inviting you in for a swim almost immediately. Which is exactly what we did. And it was perfect. If you're hungry, there's a Konoba serving up some fresh seafood, or if you're after a drink to cool you down during the hot afternoon, check out Dubovica beach bar. There's also shade under the pine trees, which makes for a welcome relief to the hot Croatian summer sun. Be warned, Dubovica does get extremely busy during the peak summer periods, so get there early to secure your spot on the pebbles. THE DETAILS Where | Dubovica beach , Hvar MILNA BEACH | HVAR’S BEST BEACHES Just outside Hvar Town is the small village of Milna, situated on a beautiful, protected cove surrounded by endless pine forests. This sleepy village brought to life all of the retro-Mediterranean feels, and we absolutely loved the laid-back vibe of the area. Although the water is not as turquoise as other beaches on the Islands, it's super clear and a perfect spot for a little snorkelling. Due to the pebbles, we recommend hiring a sunbed. In town, there's a small market, and a number of restaurants to get your fresh fish fix. There's also a little bakery if you're after something smaller/cheaper. THE DETAILS Where | Milna beach , Hvar BEST BEACHES NEAR STARI GRAD, JELSA AND VRBOSKA OSLIC BEACH IN STARI GRAD A visit to Stari Grad wouldn’t be complete without a dip in the clear blue waters of Croatia’s Med. Just outside of Stari Grad town is Oslic Beach, a typically Mediterranean ‘beach’ made up of a small stretch of sand, concrete and rocks. It’s certainly not the best beach on Hvar, but the closest to town to cool off in. It does get super busy in the early afternoon, and in the later afternoon the sea breeze picks up, making it a little choppy, so we recommend arriving earlier rather than later. There are no shops or restaurants the further you walk out of town, so pack yourself some food, and a few cheeky beers and bring some water (not single-use bottled, of course!). THE DETAILS Where | Oslic beach, Stari Grad Read more | Our guide to Stari Grad MASLINICA BEACH A beautifully secluded cove just north of pretty Vrboska , Maslinica has some of the clearest water on all of Hvar. The 'beach' isn't sandy, rather there are flat, natural stone slabs that make the perfect spot to set up your beach towel and soak up some rays. If you have snorkelling gear, the clear water allows for great underwater explorations, however, if you'd prefer to explore more of the spectacular surroundings, there are walking paths between the surrounding coves. There are no bars or konobas close by, so head to nearby Vrboska for lunch if you get hungry or thirsty, before returning to Maslinica for the afternoon. THE DETAILS Where | Maslinica beach, Hvar Read more | A mini- guide to Vrboska town MINA BEACH, JELSA A slice of paradise a short walk outside of Jelsa, Mina beach is typical Hvar beach; a stunningly turquoise cove surrounded by pines and the ubiquitous drone of crickets. Mina is a perfect beach for families, with the sandy, shallow cove making it easy for children to swim safely, while the rocky terrace is perfect for sunbathing. As you can imagine, the beach does get quite busy during the peak summer months, so arrive early, or later in the day. Close by is the fantastic Mina restaurant, which serves delicious Dalmatian cuisine with epic views overlooking the bay. We wouldn't go out of our way to visit Mina beach, but if you're staying in Jelsa, it's a great beach close to town. THE DETAILS Where | Mina beach, Hvar Read more | Our favourite things to do on Hvar Island HVAR TOWN | Our Favourite Things to do in Hvar Town BEST SECLUDED BEACHES ON HVAR ISLAND MALO ZARACE BEACH Probably our favourite beach, Malo Zaraće, which we’re reluctantly telling you about because we can’t bear the thought of others finding our little slice of heaven. The day we visited, we had the beach all to ourselves, and spent hours in the outrageously clear waters enjoying ourselves. Alas, we're letting you in on our little secret. Zaraće is located around 30 minutes drive from Hvar Town , off the main road to Stari Grad . Take the turnoff and follow a steep road down, before parking and walking down a set of stairs to Malo beach. If you’ve hired a boat, you can also reach Malo Zarace by following the coast east, passing Pokonji Dol and Milna. Be prepared to be blown away by the colour of the water, and the sheer beauty of the landscapes around you. There are no shops or restaurants, so pack yourself lunch and a few cheeky beers and settle in for the most perfect day in Hvar. THE DETAILS Where | Zaraće beach , Hvar Read more | Our favourite things to do in Hvar Town JAGODNA BEACH, SVETA NEDALJA After doing our own research about the best beaches on Hvar, we stumbled across Jagodna, a tiny, secluded cove located in between Sveta Nedalja and Ivan Dolac, and we knew we had to visit. It may be hard to get to, but it’s definitely worth the time and effort for one reason - sand! Yes, Jagodna has a mostly sandy beach which is a delightful feeling after trying to navigate large pebbles every time you want to swim. Jagodna beach is also absolutely stunning; set at the foot of bright orange cliffs and forested slopes, with bright blue waters glistening in the sun. We definitely recommend visiting in Jagodna before mid-afternoon, when the sun starts to drop behind the surrounding cliffs. THE DETAILS Where | Jagodna beach , Hvar READ MORE | 18 Incredible Things to do on Hvar Island IVAN DOLAC BEACH The small village of Ivan Dolac is located around an hour drive from Hvar Town , surrounded by steep slopes filled with pine trees and vineyards. While the surroundings are impossibly beautiful, it’s the beach that makes this little town worth visiting. This small pebble beach could almost pass as sand, meaning a relatively comfortable sunbathing experience. But the real joy is how quiet it is - apart from locals, very few people visit here. So, do as we did; hire a car, pack a picnic, and head to Ivan Dolac beach for a relaxing day by the sea, away from it all. THE DETAILS Where | Ivan Dolac beach , Hvar LUĆIŠIĆA BEACH, NEAR SVETA NEDALJA Think of Lučišća beach as an insiders tip, as, while we never made it there, our hosts on Hvar raved about it. Lučišća beach is situated on the new road from Hvar Town to Sveta Nedalja which, unfortunately for us, is unpaved and our car hire company would not allow it. We thought about pushing it but in the end , thought better of the idea. If you've managed to hire a 4WD, or are prepared to walk to Lučišća beach from Dubovica or Sveta Nedalja, you'll be in for a turquoise water treat. THE DETAILS Where | Lučišća beach , Hvar stoke that wanderlust: 42 photos from croatia that will inspire your travels BEST BEACHES AND BAYS ON THE PAKLENI ISLANDS Just off Hvar lies the Pakleni Islands , an archipelago made up of 16 pine-covered islands and turquoise coves. We visited during our favourite days out on Hvar, where we hired a small speedboat and ventured around the beautiful bays and beaches of the islands. Here are our favourite beaches and bays on the islands (or read our Pakleni Islands guide) PALMIZANA BEACH, PALKENI ISLAND One of the best, and certainly the most popular, beaches in this archipelago is Palmižana. Although small, the beach is filled with sunbeds while the day away (sunbeds are available for hire, ranging from 70 - 100 kuna for the day). Flanked by a number of good Konoba's and bars, it's the perfect place to spend the whole day relaxing. there's also the chance to explore a little more of the surrounding area, You can get to Palmižana via water taxi, or you can cruise to the bay yourself in a small, easy-to-drive, boat from one of the many companies on Hvar island. The bay, and beach, does get very busy, so as always, get there early.

It might also have the brightest blue waters we saw on Hvar, which we made the most of by swimming in it for at least an hour (needed - it was HOT!). If you’ve hired a boat for the day (totally recommended), head to Mlini around lunchtime and enjoy a fresh seafood BBQ from one of the many small restaurants. Then, park yourself on a sunbed for an afternoon of sun therapy and swimming. You can hire sunbeds, per day or per hour.

Head to Jerolim Island in the Pakleni Islands, which is home to one of the most famous FKK beaches in the world. Jerolim island itself is a beautiful little island, covered in low lying pine, sheltered bays and coves, perfect for swimming, and a little restaurant that welcomes naturists. There are also many places to shade yourself should the searing sun prove too much. TOP PAKLENI ISLANDS BAYS The crystal-clear waters surrounding the Pakleni islands are perfect for a dip… or ten. There are many hidden coves around the archipelago which provide the ideal spot to spend a few hours enjoying the Adriatic. If you’ve packed your snorkel and mask, it’s also a great opportunity to explore underwater life. Some of our favourite bays and beaches including: The two large bays on Sveti Klement after Vinogradisce Bay (unfortunately they don't have a name) Zdrilca beach, located on Marinkovac Island A MAP OF THE BEST BEACHES ON HVAR ISLAND, CROATIA We’ve created a detailed map of Hvar’s best beaches, as well as where to eat, which you can download for your visit.

HOW TO VISIT HVAR’S BEST BEACHES WHERE TO FIND THE BEST BEACHES ON HVAR If you're coming to Hvar expecting long, white sandy beaches like those on Menorca or Sardinia, you're going to be disappointed - the bulk of Hvar's beaches, like most of Croatia, are made up of large stone beaches, rocky coves, or man-made slabs. But what Hvar lacks in sand, it makes up for in the clearest blue waters, hidden coves, and vast natural beauty. In many ways, we actually prefer diving straight into the sea from our own secluded cove than dealing with sand (sacrilege, coming from two Australians!). Fortunately, this means it doesn't take much to find a perfect spot in which to enjoy the salty waters of the Adriatic, and the best beaches on Hvar can be found scattered all across the island. HVAR TOWN Hvar town is home to a number of awesome coves and beaches, as well as private beach bars which beckon those on a short trip to the island. THE NORTH In the north, beyond Stari Grad, Vrboska and Jelsa, you'll find exquisite coves overlooking the mountains of Brac island. These coves are quieter, much like this part of the island, and are great for families or those looking to escape the crowds of Hvar Town. THE SOUTH To the south, you'll find remote beaches and a much more relaxed vibe. It's these beaches that are perfect for sunset swims as the sun slowly dips over the horizon. And then there are the nearby Pakleni Islands, just a short boat ride away. Home to mesmerising bays, all you need to do is drop anchor, dive in, and enjoy some of the clearest water imaginable. But really, any beach on Hvar where you place your towel will be amazing! WHEN IS THE BEST TIME TO VISIT HVAR'S BEST BEACHES? We're massive fans of visiting Hvar Island during the shoulder seasons (April - early June, Sept-Oct). Not only are the days still long and the sea warm, but the crowds are smaller and more manageable, making the island extremely pleasant, and the beaches quieter. Beaches close to Hvar Town can be overrun with day-trippers during the middle of the day, so we recommend visiting these beaches either early in the day or later in the afternoon. Our favourite time of day to visit many of the beaches on the south of the Island, such as Pokonji Dol, Mekićevica, Dubovica, Milna, and Malo Zarace, is during the late afternoon, as the light turns the sky and sea orange. However, if you wish to experience the beautiful blues of the Adriatic, visit Hvar's beaches during the early afternoon. The more remote beaches on the north of Hvar tend to be better in the morning - early afternoon.

It’s super detailed and provides accommodation options for all budgets, including our personal recommendations. Basically, it’s your Hvar accommodation bible , so use it to book for your stay!

{"url": "https://www.thecommonwanderer.com/blog/parikia-paros-guide", "title": "A Guide Parikia, Paros' Vibrant Capital Town | The Common Wanderer", "publish_date": "Jun 1", "text": "Charming Laneways and Epic Sunsets: Our Guide to Parikia, Paros' Alluring Capital Europe Greece Jun 1 Written By The Common Wanderer Vibrant Parikia is a must-see town on Paros Island. Our complete guide includes what to see in Parikia, plus our personal recommendations on where to stay, eat and how to get there. When compared to the effortless calm and beauty of Naoussa , Parikia feels jarring, like the chaos of Athens. However, spend time strolling the whitewashed streets and historic laneways and you’ll begin to realise that Parikia has its own charm. The Islands’ historic capital is nestled on a small hill overlooking the Port, and the old town is filled with cobbled laneways, old churches, shops, restaurants and the historic Frankish Castle. It’s also the epicentre of life and commerce on Paros ; it’s here where locals do go about their daily lives, so the town has a far more raw feel to it. The town caters not only for tourists, but for locals too, so prices are cheaper, and you can find just about anything you need on the streets. While we wouldn’t spend any longer than a day exploring the town, it is worth your time, especially for the strong culinary scene, and for the somewhat cheaper, yet equally cool sunset bars which line the coast just south of the port. LOVE OUR PHOTOS? Edit like us with our European Summers Preset Packs , and mobile video filters , inspired by the warm hues and vibes of summers spent in Europe PARIKIA SNAPSHOT WHERE | Paros Island, Cyclades HOW TO GET THERE | Ferry from Athens, Bus/Car from Naoussa WHERE TO STAY | Yria Boutique Hotel WHAT TO SEE | Panagia Ekatontapiliani, Frankish Castle, the old town laneways, watch sunset WHERE TO EAT | Stou Fred, Boutaraki, Hops & Colors, Cuoro Rosso PLAN YOUR VISIT TO PARIKIA, PAROS WHERE IS PARIKIA Parikia (sometimes known as Paroikia) is the capital and largest town on the island of Paros , in the Cycladic Archipelago, Greece. The port town is located to the west of the Island, about 190 km southeast of Athens. The ferry journey takes around 3 - 5 hours, depending on boat type. HOW LONG SHOULD YOU SPEND IN PARIKIA? You can see and experience the best things to do in Parikia in a day, as the town is small enough to walk to each major attraction. However, given the myriad of restaurants and bars in the town, we’d recommend visiting more than once, depending on how long you plan to visit Paros Island . WHERE TO STAY IN PARIKIA From cosy, family-run hotels to extravagant beachside villas, there are plenty of accommodation options on Paros to suit every style, traveller or budget. YRIA ISLAND BOUTIQUE HOTEL Yria Boutique Hotel , situated high on a verdant hill overlooking the yawning bay of Parasporos, is every bit the laid-back luxury stay you’d imagine on a Greek island. From pink bougainvillaea climbing whitewashed arches to the open-air spa surrounded by fruit trees, to the palm trees fringing the pool, Yria looks idyllic. It also makes claims to be eco-friendly, which we like. But dig a little way into the reviews, and you’ll see it might be too good to be true. There are better places to stay for the price, closer to Parikia or Naoussa. THE DETAILS BOOK | YRIA BOUTIQUE HOTEL BETHLEHEM HISTORIC TOWNHOUSE Despite being in the middle of Parikia, with its twisting lanes and squares that come alive on a summer night, Bethlehem Townhouse is a nest of tranquillity for a chilled-out family stay. The two-bedroom home was built in 1600 and renovated more recently in 2016. From the traditional Cycladic furniture to the sunny rooftop terrace, the restorations blend original charm with loads of natural materials and natural light. It’s everything that makes Parikia more appealing than Naoussa for experience-seekers; laid-back and unpretentious, yet still overflowing with the charm of Greek island life. THE DETAILS BOOK | BETHLEHEM TOWNHOUSE PAROS BACKPACKERS If you’re looking to save money and make friends, book a bed at Paros Backpackers . There are standard dorms and private rooms for groups, all with refrigerators and en-suite bathrooms. But the social scene is the real attraction. Whether lounging by the pool, congregating on the rooftop to watch a stunning sunset or cooking together in the kitchen, you’re guaranteed to meet all kinds of friendly folks. The owner will invite you to a WhatsApp group that’s great for finding adventure buddies. And the party moves on when the rooftop closes at midnight, so you can still get a good night’s sleep. THE DETAILS BOOK | PAROS BACKPACKERS READ MORE | Where to stay on Paros THINGS TO DO IN PARIKIA, PAROS STEP INSIDE THE HISTORIC PANAGIA EKATONTAPILIANI CHURCH Parikia’s main attraction is its storied ‘Church of 100 Doors’, Ekatontapiliani. An essential thing to do on Paros , this stunning Byzantine-era stone church is situated in the heart of Parikia, and is one of the oldest and most important Christian relics in Greece. The story of the church is fabled - St. Helena, the mother of Constantine the Great, stopped at a chapel at this very site on Paros on her way to the Holy Land and vowed to build a church there if she found the True Cross. Find the True Cross she did, and after her death, her son began to build the basilica, a grand structure filled with arches and domes. What you see now is that very church, which in turn sits atop an ancient Grecian temple dedicated to Aphrodite, whose pillars you can see through the glass floor below. The centrepiece of the church is the marble screen that sits in front of the altar, which is inlaid with gold and silver icons, including an intricately carved Madonna. Instead of the standard frescoes, the walls are instead filled with beautiful stone masonry, minimalistic and humble. It’s wonderful to witness, even for those like us who have zero religious affiliation. THE DETAILS Where | Panagia Ekatontapiliani, Parikia Cost | Free Opening Hours | Daily: 7 am - 9 pm Tips | Act respectably, and remember to cover shoulders and knees EXPLORE THE OLD TOWN & FRANKISH CASTLE High above Parikia, overlooking the endless blue of the Aegean sea, the bustling port and the white-washed roofs lies the Frankish Castle of Parikia. Built by the Venetians who presided over much of the Cycladic archipelago in 1260 AD, the Frankish Castle isn’t your typical castle, rather it incorporates many historical structures and sanctuaries from around Paros into the castle walls - what you’ll notice is vast, thick walls of marble and rock, supporting the upper parts of Parikia’s old town. The blue-domed Church of Agios Konstantinos is the highest point of Parikia, and home to some of the best views in the town, while the narrow laneways and cute courtyards make for a picturesque stroll through this part of Parikia, especially at sunset when the area comes alive with marmalade hues baking the laneways in gold. GO SHOPPING ON OLD MARKET STREET Home to cute laneways, historic churches, excellent boutiques, and traditional souvenirs Deep within the old town of Parikia is an old market street, a labyrinth of typical tourist stores selling souvenirs such as linen, shirts, magnets, soaps etc, and boutiques, art, design, and jewellery and craft stores. On top of this, there is a range of excellent boutiques, selling far more affordable summer threads than those found in Naoussa . With reasonable prices, original pieces and a more laidback shopping experience than those found in Santorini or Mykonos, it’s here you need to shop on your Greek Islands getaway. For something more upmarket, try Leto , and for something handmade, try Magissa handmade creations . VISIT PARIKIA’S BEST BEACHES While the best beaches on Paros are located to the east and south of Parikia, there are a number of quality beaches that can be found close to town, especially for those who are looking for a lazy afternoon by the sea. The benefit of most Parikian beaches is that they are protected from the summer Meltemi winds, making them some of the most comfortable on Paros. Here are three of the best beaches close to Parikia, Paros: PARIKIA BEACH The best beach located close to town, Parikia beach , is a long, white sand beach with crystal clear water and relaxed vibes. Due it the shallow waters, Parikia beach is also perfect for families with children or those who prefer to wade, rather than swim. If you’re after food or want to relax on a sunbed all day, Tango Mar beach club is your best option. Similar to Livadia, it’s also home to a beautiful sunset view. LIVADIA BEACH Livadia beach is located to the northeast of Parikia, and is one of the closest to town. As such, it gets super busy during the afternoon and early evening, as the sunsets from here are special. There is also a range of good restaurants that line the shore and promenade, without the inflated prices of Naoussa. If it were us, though, we’d walk slightly further to the longer, cleaner and more beautiful Parikia beach. DELFINI BEACH A small cove located to the south of Parikia promenade, Delfini is the closest beach to the old town. Honestly, though, we’d probably give it a miss, considering the range of better beaches just a short walk or drive away. Unless, of course, you just want a quick dip to cool down, then by all means jump right in! PAROS ARCHAEOLOGICAL MUSEUM Paros is filled with history dating back thousands of years, from antiquity through to the Ottoman era, so it is little wonder the Island is filled with antique treasures and artefacts to showcase. The Archeological Museum of Paros, located in downtown Parikia, does just that, providing an in-depth overview of Paros’ rich cultural history. There is a range of statues, including those of Artemis, Gorgon, Athena, and the Nike of Paros, Roman mosaics, ancient amphoras, pots, pans, burial casks, coins and more. A walk through the museum takes 20-40 minutes depending on how fast you move, and information plaques are provided in English and Greek for all pieces. So if you’re into your ancient Greek history, it’s worth a look. THE DETAILS Where | Archeological Museum of Paros Cost | €2 per person WATCH A FAMOUS PAROS SUNSET FROM PARIKIA Watching a Greek summer sunset is a ritual, and watching it with a cocktail in hand is an essential part of said ritual. And on Paros, the sunsets are breathtaking. No matter where you are on the Island, you’ll be enchanted by the outrageous array of colours that seem to change every few minutes, and then linger long into the night. Parikia is one of the best places on Paros to watch the sunset, with a huge array of classy cocktail bars coming alive in the late afternoon each day, the best of which provide uninterrupted views of the sunset, similar in many ways to the Santorini sunsets over Oia. There are a huge array of bars located in the laneways of the Castle, but our favourite is Bebop , a boho-chic bar and restaurant serving some of the best cocktails in Parikia Paros, and Peruvian small plates, and with a huge outdoor terrace that has views for dayyyyyys. For drinks, you can’t go wrong with a sunset cocktail (€11 - €15 each) - either an Aperol Spritz or Negroni goes down well, but for something different, try the Bebop Zombie - a delicious mix of rums (yes, multiple!), lime, passionfruit, pineapple, syrup and aromatic bitters. They also serve a Cycladic craft beer called 56 Islands, which is refreshing on a hot afternoon. We also suggest Kastro if Bebop is booked out. VISIT PETRA FARM Long time readers of The Common Wanderer will know that we always like to seek out attractions and activities that are a little off the beaten track, especially in the sustainability and eco-tourism space, and Petra Farm is one such place. The family-run Petra Farm, located above Kolymbithres about 10 minutes from Parikia, was set up in the late ’80s, a small scale area of 5 acres, growing typically Mediterranean crops such as olive and grapevines. However it wasn’t until Alkis, a hip, late 20-something with a passion for modern agriculture and the environment, took over the family farm, did it turn into its current guise. Alkis runs the Organic Farm Tours and Tasting experience, which is both informative, fun and highly recommended. He has a knack for teaching and informing with personality, which makes the tour both entertaining and educational. The tour starts at the entrance of their traditional, organic farm that overlooks the beautiful bay of Naoussa , before taking in the terraces which are home to a range of Mediterranean crops. Here, Alkis tells you all about sustainable cultivation practices, and how they impact the flavour profiles of each crop. After seeing the ridiculously cute goats and chickens, the tour moves to the balcony of the family home, where a tasting session (or lunch) occurs while overlooking Naoussa bay. Here, you’re in for a taste sensation, sampling the locally grown products including the tastiest capers you’ll eat in your life, all accompanied by Petra wine. A visit here, to Petra farm, is undoubtedly one of the best things to do in Paros . Note: If you wish to purchase any Petra farm products, there’s a store located in downtown Naoussa. We grabbed ourselves some capers and dried oregano to take home. THE DETAILS Where | Petra Farm, Paros Island Cost | From €25 per person for tour & tasting, from €35 per person for tour tasting, tasting & lunch Tour duration | 2 hours Tips | Organise 48 hours in advance. Book here EAT ALL THE GELATO Being the ice cream enthusiasts that we are (our life motto is “an ice cream a day keeps the doctor away\"), we couldn’t help but try gelato in Parikia, especially given the extreme heat which accompanied our visit. The best gelato in town is Vanilla Gelateria , located right in the heart of Parikia old town. Home to fresh, homemade gelato in that quintessential Greek-style - thick, creamy, and smooth (we definitely feel gelato is heavier in Greece than in Italy!), as well as fruit sorbet, there’s something for everyone here. We recommend the pistachio and Kinda Bueno flavours, which were fresh and mouth-watering when served with a waffle cone (always go the waffle cone!). If you’re into sorbets, the mandarine flavour is a winner. WHERE TO EAT AND DRINK IN PARIKIA, PAROS Parikia is home to a surprising selection of quality restaurants, with everything from high-end culinary experiences, down to your traditional street food options. Below are a selection of our favourite restaurants: STOU FRED | Bougie fine dining in downtown Parikia. Set amongst a beautiful garden, Stou Fred has a distinctly French menu that changes weekly. Perfect if you’re after an alternative to Greek cuisine. Book well in advance, as this might be Parikia’s best restaurant BOUNTARAKI | A popular restaurant in downtown Parikia offering the best of Greek cuisine using exceptional produce. Get the Sea Bream and Watermelon Salad CUORE ROSSO | Hidden amongst the myriad of laneways in the Old Town, Cuore Rosso serves authentic Italian pizza in a beautiful hidden courtyard. Go for the pizza, stay for the Tiramisu HOPS AND COLORS | Super cool craft beer bar located in the Frankish Castle, different from anything else on the Island. Sells a huge array of Greek craft beers, perfect for watching sunset CAFE SYMPOSIUM PAROS | One of the prettiest cafes in all of Paros, serving exceptional coffee and delicious brunch DISTRATO CAFE BISTROT | Situated in a beautiful shaded square, Distrato is a super hip cafe serving delicious food and oh-so-delicious coffee TRAVEL INSURANCE | STAY SAFE IN GREECE If you can't afford travel insurance, you really can't afford to travel.

Our Hvar travel guide is filled with everything you need to know before you visit, including what to see and do, where to stay, and how to get there and get around + more. Hvar island might just be the best Mediterranean Island. Set off the sparkling Dalmatian Riviera, Hvar is rich with history, culture, cuisine, architecture, natural beauty, and beaches . It’s a place where crooked cobblestoned lanes lead you through stunning Venetian architecture and ancient fortresses, past bustling restaurants serving up mouthwateringly authentic local fare and waterfront bars that roar to life in the evenings with everyone from the rich and famous to backpackers on their first sailing adventure. Where mountains are filled with lavender and olive groves, world-class wineries straddle hills and plains, and rocky coves are home to the clearest water you’ve ever seen. Surprisingly diverse, Hvar is both a hedonistic paradise, a ‘mini Ibiza’ to many, and a chilled paradise where slow lunches and afternoons by the sea are a way of life. Whatever your travel style, there’s something for everyone in this paradise, and this post aims to provide a robust and curated guide to Hvar Island. From what to see and do, to where to stay and eat, the best beaches and coves, to the best dining and wine experiences, our post gives you all the information you need to enjoy Hvar Island. LOVE OUR PHOTOS? Edit like us with our European Summers Preset Packs , and mobile video filters , inspired by the warm hues and vibes of summers spent in Europe HVAR ISLAND SNAPSHOT WHEN TO VISIT | May - early July, mid-September - October HOW TO GET THERE | Ferry from Split WHERE TO STAY | Hvar Town for party, Stari Grad for chill WHAT TO SEE | Hvar Town, Stari Grad, Pakleni Islands, Vrboska, Jelsa, endless beaches HVAR HAS NO INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT… If you’re planning to fly directly to Hvar, think again - the island does not have an international airport. Whether it be geography or wonderful forward planning by the municipality, we think this is a wonderful thing, as it reduces the demand on the island and keeps noise pollution to a minimum. But this does mean it can be a little tricky to get to Hvar. First, you’ll need to fly to the nearby city of Split, and then catch a ferry to Hvar. It’s all very manageable, and we’ve written all about it below, and here. BUT GETTING TO HVAR FROM SPLIT IS SUPER EASY Thankfully, while there might not be a direct flight to Hvar Island, getting from Split to Hvar is easy. There are two options - catch the bus service from the airport to Split port, and then one of the many daily ferries to Hvar island. Or, catch the once-daily Split Express service, which stops off at Brac Island on the way. The easiest, most cost-effective option is the former, and we recommend this option to everyone. For a more thorough guide on how to get from Split to Hvar , which you can read here - it outlines every Split to Hvar option, including ferries to Hvar Town, Stari Grad, and Jelsa. It’s worth noting the Split to Hvar ferry route is extremely busy during the height of summer, so we recommend booking at least 24 hours prior. Tickets can be purchased online here . Expect to pay anywhere between HRK 40 - 110 one way, per person, (season/ferry dependent), HRK 47 one way, per person to Stari Grad. Alternatively, tickets can be purchased in Split at the tourism centre on Split Riva, opposite Diocletian’s Palace, or at the ticket booths further down the Port of Split. The return journey departs from Hvar Riva, and tickets can be purchased online , or from the adjoining ticket office. Note | if the direct ferry from Split to Hvar is booked out, you can also take the ferry to Stari Grad , and catch a local bus or taxi to Hvar town. Read | Our Split to Hvar (and return) Guide HVAR IS ONE OF THE SUNNIEST DESTINATIONS IN EUROPE Let’s be honest, Europe is dreary for six months of the year and when summer rolls around, it’s a good dose of vitamin D we all desire, or better yet, crave. Hvar island is one of the sunniest destinations in Europe, home to on average 7.7 hours of glorious summer sun (or 2760 hours a year). For almost eight hours a day, this beautiful island is bathed in life-giving sun, making it one of the most desirable destinations to visit in Europe for sun-seekers. Better yet, it’s not as affected by the winds that whip up a storm throughout the Mediterranean during the peak summer months. During the peak season, the weather is spectacular, with the average daytime temperature around 25 - 35 degrees, and long. HVAR IS INSANELY BEAUTIFUL We’ve travelled far and wide and Hvar is, without a doubt, one of the most gorgeous places we’ve ever visited. Yes, it’s quintessentially beautiful - from the white-washed towns and historic cobbled streets of Hvar Town , Stari Grad and Vrboska to the clear blue waters and almost-empty beaches and coves of the Islands’ south; the crystal-clear waters and deserted lagoons of the Pakleni islands , to the quaint, home-style restaurants serving delicious Dalmatian fare; and the photogenic rolling hills swathed in layers of fragrant lavender, olive trees, and fertile plains filled with verdant vineyards producing excellent red wine, Hvar Island is so much more than just the glitz and glamour of its main town. However, there’s also an intangible beauty that exists in its sleepy towns and alleyways. In these twisting laneways, there’s the clatter of cutlery and the waft of something delicious being cooked, no doubt by a grandma using a thousand-year-old recipe; the soundtrack of families enjoying their Sunday lunch together. Locals greet each other in doorways, pausing to chat before continuing on their way. Little boutiques peek out from almost-hidden alcoves. Birds skitter along cobblestones, and in places, it’s so quiet you can hear the echo of your own footfall. This is a world away from the jam-packed Riva and touristy main square, and there’s a lot to love about that. Simply put, Hvar is insanely beautiful. HVAR ISLAND IS MUCH MORE THAN JUST HVAR TOWN Hvar Town is, without doubt, the crowning glory of the island. It's a town where stunning Venetian architecture, ancient fortresses, and winding old town lanes are illuminated each afternoon by outstanding sunsets. A town where incredible restaurants serve the day’s best catch, a town where world-class bars keep revellers coming back again and again; and where some truly down-to-earth locals exist. But it’s not the only destination on Hvar Island. In fact, we’d go as far as saying a trip to Hvar isn’t complete without exploring other, equally beautiful, parts of the island. No matter how long you’re on the Island, we encourage you to escape the Hvar town bubble and explore the rest of the island - these are the places we recommend: STARI GRAD After our third visit to the quaint town of Stari Grad , we realised that we may have made a mistake by spending the entirety of our six weeks on the island living in Hvar town . It's not like we didn't like Hvar town; far from it. It's just that Stari Grad, with its quiet laneways, relaxed vibe, friendly people and far cheaper prices(!) was just ‘more us’. Stari Grad is the epitome of a rustic Mediterranean coastal town . Its ancient white-stone streets and laneways are perfect for lazy strolls, and around each corner, another historic church, bougainvillaea-covered staircase, or historic archway can be found. The epicentre of the action is Srinjo kola (Middle St.), once a hub of craftsmen and merchants, now filled with quaint cafes, delis and traditional souvenir stores. One place we absolutely recommend stopping by is Za Pod Zub , a hip gourmet store run by a lovely young French couple. They offer premium products sourced from Hvar and all of Croatia, including olives (we bought a tub and it was heaven), cheese, chocolate, and some of the best wine on Hvar. JELSA Jelsa is the quintessential Croatian seaside village - a pretty Riva, gorgeous, white-washed laneways, exceptional seafood restaurants, and a laidback atmosphere that just exudes summer bliss. And while Jelsa might not have the beauty and brashness of Hvar Town, or the history of Stari Grad, its appeal lies in its family-friendly nature. Dating back as far as the 14th Century, Jelsa perhaps doesn’t have the outstanding cultural heritage of Hvar or Stari Grad, however, there are a number of things we recommend doing while in the town: Stroll the Riva | While not as pretty as Hvar or Stari Grad, Jelsa Riva is bustling, especially in the early evening. It’s worth a stroll, and a seaside meal Church of St. Mary | Dating back to 1331, and fortified in the 16th century, St. Mary’s is Jelsa’s crowning historical beauty. Take a look inside and see a statue of Madonna brought here by refugees in 1539 Church of St. John | A picturesque square located in the heart of the old town. In summer, Antun Dobronić festival is held here, which includes compositions by Antun Dobronić (Jelsa’s most famous son), as well as other Croatian creatives’ works of music, theatre, art and literature Mina Beach | The most popular beach in Jelsa, Mina is a large, shallow bay just a short walk from the Riva. Perfect for family, or anyone looking to enjoy Hvar’s outrageously clear waters Wine tasting | Sample some of Hvar's best drops from nearby wineries VRBOSKA Its nickname 'little Venice' might be somewhat of a stretch given there's only one canal through the entire village, but that doesn't detract from the fact that the charming town of Vrboska really is worth a visit. Indeed, our relaxing afternoon in Vrboska - strolling through the pretty laneways and canal and discovering some of its major landmarks, eating traditional Dalmatian food, and enjoying the MUCH slower pace of life - was one of our favourite things to do on Hvar. Some sights we recommend visiting include: Vrboska canal | postcard-pretty, full of beautiful canal-side houses and stone arch bridges The fortress church of Saint Mary | imposing church/fortress that offered refuge to locals during times of war Wine tasting | sample some of Hvar's best drops here, with many cellar doors located throughout the town and canal Vrboska harbour | take an afternoon stroll around the harbour to get a truly beautiful view of the whole town If you're keen to escape the crowds and chaos of Hvar town , we absolutely recommend Vrboska. BRUSJE Founded in the 16th century as a shepherd settlement the charming town of Brusje is home to the island’s popular lavender fields. A short drive from Hvar town , this ancient village lies somewhat in a state of decay, dotted with rustic stone homes and narrow laneways. The surrounding fields are where Hvar's lavender production occurs, and this is the best place to see the rolling fields of purple that the island is so famed for. The best time to see Hvar under a purple blanket is late June, which also coincides with the island's Lavender Festival that occurs in neighbouring Velo Grablje. If you do head out this way, you MUST eat at Izletiste family farm, which serves traditional Dalmatian cuisine, fresh juices and offers some of the best views of Hvar. They also sell lavender-infused honey, which is a perfect gift for that special someone at home. THE DETAILS Where | Brusje Eat | Izletiste family farm SPEND A DAY EXPLORING THE PAKLENI ISLANDS… We both agree that the best day we spent on Hvar Island was when we hired a small 'pasara' boat from Hvar Boats and explored the nearby Pakleni Islands (read our guide to the Pakleni Islands here ). Setting off early, we somehow navigated the narrow Hvar strait (we had no prior boating experience!), before arriving at an unbelievably clear, turquoise bay for our first swim. It set the tone for the day; we'd find ourselves a beautiful, quiet bay, drop our anchor and jump straight off the bow into the clear blue waters before relaxing in the beautiful Mediterranean sun. It really was a perfect day, and definitely one of the best things to do on Hvar Island. Some of our favourite bays and beaches include: The two large bays after Vinogradisce Bay (unfortunately, they don't have a name) Zdrilca beach Mlini beach Boats come with a cooler box, so we recommend stocking up on food, water (bring your own!) and beers for the day ahead. You'll need to ask for this and snorkelling gear. Unfortunately, while in the past you could operate a pasara boat without a boat licence, current laws require a national or digital boating license. You will get a lesson from your vendor, which we recommend you listen to, as it takes a while to get used to the steering and engine. It's also important to note that while the boat is insured (up to €550), the propeller and anchor are not, so you'll be liable for any damage (which is surprisingly easy on the rocks). Keep an eye out for large ferries and boats operating in the area - it's the main route from Split to Hvar and Korcula! READ| the best day trip from Hvar - Pakleni Islands guide EXPLORE MORE OF THE ISLAND WITH THESE TOURS Hvar is a wonderful island to explore at your own pace, however, there are some places you just can’t visit yourself.

BOOK | Hvar: Guided Walking Tour READ MORE | Our guide to the best day trips on Hvar HVAR IS SO MUCH MORE THAN JUST A PARTY ISLAND After spending six weeks on the island, we got to know some local residents quite well and asked them what they thought of this party scene. The response was always the same: they couldn't believe what their island had become, especially in the summer months. Some recounted stories of drunk tourists having sex at 8 am in St. Stephens Square (the most sacred and important square to residents on the island), that some drunks vandalised the town centre, and how the thumping bass has ruined any sort of tranquillity. It seems that travellers and backpackers visit Hvar and seem to lose all sense and respect for those who will call the island home long after they’ve shaken off their hangovers and gone home. As fellow travellers, we think that's pretty shit. There are so many amazing things to see and do on Hvar that it seems a waste to come and spend the entire time drunk, looking for a party - there are better places to party in Europe - Mykonos, Ibiza, and Mallorca spring to mind. If you're going to come and party on Hvar, by all means, get tipsy, have fun, and party till all hours; but just take a moment and respect the locals, the culture, and the environment at the same time. If you’re after some slower-paced fun, Hvar is actually home to some of the finest red wine in Europe (their Reds, in particular, are famous the world over). Hora Farm, located on the UNESCO-listed Stari Grad plain , is the best place to sample some of Hvar’s finest, as well as offers a unique wine tasting experience. The owners run through the history of the farm, and the type of grapes they grow, before a wine tasting session. In addition to their range of locally produced wines, the family-run establishment prepares delicious local Dalmatian fare, which is served on the terrace overlooking the most beautiful vineyard. Popular wineries we recommend you visit include: Zlatan Otok in Sveta Nedilja Duboković in Jelsa Vino Tomic in Jelsa HVAR IS NOT A BUDGET DESTINATION, BUT IT’S ALSO AFFORDABLE Hvar has a reputation for being expensive, and for good reason; it's a place frequented by the stars, and a place deemed good enough by, among others, Prince Harry, Beyonce and George Clooney. From early June, the prices for just about everything increases, sometimes quite dramatically, making the island tough for anyone other than the wealthy. Accommodation, especially in popular areas, can exceed €200 per night and will likely be your largest cost. Eating a meal in a restaurant can set you back at least €30 per meal, and beers at beach bars will set you back around €5. BUT. There are ways to make your Hvar getaway more affordable: Travel out of season | Probably the #1 way to save money is to travel during the shoulder season. If you can, travel from May - June or from mid-September. Due to decreased demand, accommodation is heavily reduced during this period Accommodation | Book accommodation outside of Hvar Town, such as Stari Grad , Jelsa, Vrboska, or on the outskirts of Hvar Town. Here, you can get apartments/Airbnb for under €100 per night. Or, try out camping. Hvar has a heap of campsites away from the main tourist attractions that are both affordable, and relaxed Cook your own meals | If you rent a Hvar Airbnb /apartment, make full use of the kitchen. Visit the supermarket and buy breakfast, lunch and dinner options, as well as snacks for hiking. With this method, we saved at least €50 per day on food. There is an awesome market in Hvar Town that sells affordable vegetables, meat and cheese Pre-drinks | Drinks are far cheaper from the supermarket (Konzum or Studenac), so buy booze in bulk and pre-drink before partying at Carpe Diem. And remember, don’t be a dickhead TAKE A ROAD TRIP AROUND THE ISLAND Hvar is not large, yet its geography - a large mountain range down its spine- means that much of the south of the island is off limits to public transport. But it’s here that you’ll find some of the best beaches and views on the island. It’s for this reason, among many others, that we suggest you hire a car and explore the island for a day. We did this multiple times during our visit, with the highlight when we hired a classic VW from Rapidus Hvar and slowly made our way around the island. We drove through lavender fields to the small village of Brusje, explored the Venetian streets of Stari Grad , ate delicious gelato in Jelsa, slowly made our way through the Pitve tunnel, and swam in the gloriously clear waters at Ivan Dolac and Jagodna (two of Hvar’s best beaches, trust us). We then finished the day watching the sunset from the Napoleonic fort, overlooking Hvar and Pakleni Islands . Bloody magic! While a Hvar road trip isn’t essential, we found it was the best way to really explore each corner of the", "images":

UPDATED - April 2024 Our love affair with Budapest started long ago, during Mark’s gap year visit in 2005. Back then, Budapest was gritty, grimy and slowly recovering from its Soviet occupation, but the famous beauty was there, faded somewhat, but hidden, waiting to shine once again. Over the course of a week enjoying the city, Mark fell in love with the youthful exuberance of the city, noting in his journal “I could live here”. As fate would have it, in 2019 we made the move, setting up a home in Budapest’s thriving Jewish Quarter . Now, Budapest, despite having been a resident of the city for over two years, might be our favourite city in Europe . … Budapest is a city of two - Buda and Pest, separated by the mighty Danube River, and first connected in the late 1800s by the elegant Chain Bridge. Repeatedly invaded over the centuries; by the Ottomans, Hapsburgs, Nazis and Communists, Budapest isn’t just beautiful, it’s resolute and rebellious. In the last century alone, the city has been devastated and rebuilt three times - after the defeat in WW1, again after the Nazi and Soviet invasions of WW2, and in 1956 during the anti-Soviet revolution and ensuing siege. It’s because of this past that Budapest feels more real - it might lack the fairytale charm of Prague or the endless beauty of Paris, but the city has a real depth for travellers to dive deep into. It’s also this past that makes Buda and Pest feel like two distinct cities in one - a rare treat for travellers. It’s truly remarkable what this city has to offer for travellers. From historic thermal baths to quaint cobbled streets, and exceptional gastronomy to hip ruin bars , there’s an endless amount of things to do in Budapest for all types of travellers. For us, there’s no greater city in Europe for things to see and do, whether it be over a weekend away or a long-term stay. This guide aims to showcase the very best things to do in Budapest, from two people who lived and breathed this wonderful city for over two years. We hope you enjoy it as much as us, and as always, if you want further recommendations, reach out to us on Instagram ! LOVE OUR PHOTOS?

It’s valid for 72 hours (perfect for a city break!) and gives you free public transport, plus free and/or discounted entry to the city’s main highlights, like most of the galleries and museums, for example. We highly recommend buying the Budapest Card if you plan to do plenty of sightseeing while you’re in town — and you can also use the Budapest Card to get 20% off your entry ticket at the Széchenyi thermal baths. Winning! BUY | Purchase your Budapest Card here THE BEST THINGS TO DO IN BUDAPEST RELAX IN BUDAPEST’S EXQUISITE BATHS Is there another city in the world with such an array of exceptional thermal baths? We think not. Budapest sits atop one of the largest thermal basins in the world, a curious geographical phenomenon that allows 40,000m3 of delightful, mineral-rich water to spring to the surface every day. The Romans were the first to harness the healing powers of the thermal waters before the Ottomans conquered Hungary and brought their hammam-style to the city. The result is an exceptional mix of incredible thermal bathing houses, all with their own grandiose architecture and unique features. You probably won’t have time to visit them all, so below we’ve highlighted three of our favourites, located right in the heart of the city, for your bathing pleasure. SZECHENYI BATHS A visit to Szechenyi Baths is truly one of the best things to do in Budapest. In fact, it’s so great, you should plan to visit more than once, to really soak it all in (yes, that is a pun!). The baths are one of Budapest’s most popular attractions, built-in 1913 over healing hot springs feeding 18 separate pools, 3 outdoor and 15 indoor, and a range of other wellness features including steam rooms and saunas, in the ornate complex. Szechenyi Baths are separated into two distinct sections, with the beautiful outdoor area the most popular for visitors. Here, there are three pools encased by the pastel yellow building, two heated immersion pools (one activity pool of 30 - 34 degrees, one thermal pool of 38 degrees), and the 50m swimming pool (26-28 degrees). The interior pools, while less awe-inspiring than the outdoor pools, are no less enjoyable. In total, there are 15 indoor pools ranging from 18 degrees to 40 degrees, of which a few are just not worth visiting unless you’re a regular. For more in-depth information, read our Szechenyi Baths guide . THE DETAILS Where | Állatkerti krt. 9-11 Opening Hours | Summer: Daily from 6 am - 10 pm (indoor pools close at 8 pm), Winter: Daily from 7 am to 7 pm Cost | Weekday ticket with locker: HUF 5,900, Weekend ticket with locker: HUF 6,200 - 20% discount with the Budapest Card Related | Our complete guide to visiting Szechenyi Baths BOOK | Skip the line entry to Szechenyi Baths GELLERT BATHS In the thermal bath capital of Europe , there’s one place that lays claim to being the most beautiful of them all: Gellert Baths (read our complete guide here !). An Art Nouveau architectural masterpiece brought to life early last century, there are stained glass roofs pouring golden light on the pools below, grand columns and elegant sweeping bathrooms detailed with turquoise Zsolnay mosaic tiles, and ornately-carved sculptures and ceramics dotted everywhere. It’s a feast for the eyes as well as a balm for tired, aching souls, and certainly deserving of its own affectionate nickname: ‘Palace of Baths’. Gellert also ranks as one of our favourite Budapest baths (yes, even above the more famous Szechenyi !) because it feels more local than some of its counterparts. There is an array of 13 pools and thermal baths, both indoor and outdoor and ranging from 26c to 40c, plus saunas, steam rooms, and massage treatment rooms to keep you busy during your time here! The Gellert Baths form part of the Gellert Hotel complex, on the Buda side of the river and right in front of the beautiful Szabadság (Liberty) Bridge. Budapest is a super walkable city and you can easily get to the baths on foot. If you’re coming from the Pest side, simply cross Liberty Bridge and you’re already there. As a visit to Gellert Baths is one of the best things to do in Budapest, we recommend arriving early (9 am) to enjoy the baths before the crowds arrive. THE DETAILS Where | Kelenhegyi út 4 Opening Hours | 9 am - 7 pm daily Cost | HUF 10,900 - 20% discount with the Budapest Card Related | A travellers guide to Gellert Baths BOOK | Skip the line tickets to Gellért Baths RUDAS BATHS Located right on the banks of the Danube in the heart of Budapest is the best value for money Budapest thermal bath option, Rudas Baths. Although not as visually beautiful as its city counterparts Szechenyi and Gellert, Rudas has a more authentic, local feel which makes it highly appealing. Thermal bathing has existed on the site since the 16th century when the Ottomans built a small hammam complex. The ornate, domed Turkish Bath, remains the centrepiece of the complex, with its dark, steamy environs harking back to yesteryear. The main octagonal pool and surrounding dip pools remain the best-kept secret amongst Budapest’s thermal baths. Beyond the Turkish Baths, there are an array of therapy pools throughout the complex with temperatures ranging from 10 and 42 °C (50 and 108 °F), including the insta-famous rooftop dome pool, which is the perfect place to enjoy the sunset in the summer months. There’s also a swimming pool in the centre of the complex if you’re looking to get some laps in. There are a few curious entry restrictions to the Turkish bath, including men and women-only bathing days (see below), however co-ed bathing is allowed throughout the rest of the complex each day. Rudas is located at the foot of Gellert Hill, just a short walk from Elizabeth Bridge, so if you’re staying in downtown Budapest, it’s only a short walk to visit. THE DETAILS Where | Döbrentei tér 9 Opening Hours | 6 am to 8 pm daily, Night bathing: 10 pm to 3 am, Fri and Sat, Turkish bath: Men only Mon, Wed - Fri (until 1 pm), Women only, Tues, Co-ed Fri from 1 pm, Sat - Sun Cost | Weekdays: HUF 5,500, Weekends: HUF 6,900 - 20% discount with the Budapest Card BUY | Purchase your Budapest Card here ADMIRE BUDAPEST FROM FISHERMAN’S BASTION From Fisherman’s Bastion (Halászbástya) the most enchanting views of Budapest appear - overlooking the imposing Hungarian Parliament and endless expanse of the Danube; it’s here that you really fall in love with Budapest - in fact, after living in Budapest for over two years, it’s still our favourite view. Built between 1895 and 1902 (although the original walls were built in the 1700s) in a Neo-Romanesque style by architect Frigyes Schulek, the bastion comprises seven stone towers, which symbolise the seven chieftains of Hungary. The structure itself is fairytale-esque, with turrets, towers and parapets reminding of Hogwarts. The lower terrace is home to the grand stairs, which reach towards the upper bastions and Matthias Church. Both bastions and the inner corridors form the bastion courtyard and terraces, where the towering statue of St. Stephen’s appears. The upper terrace is home to view platforms that provide uninterrupted views of the whole of Pest, as well as the seven stone towers. The vistas from Fisherman’s Bastion are mesmerising, encompassing the four main bridges of Budapest, St. Stephen’s cathedral, Gellert Hill, Margaret Island, and the pretty urban landscape of Pest. If you’re into photography (you should follow us on IG if you are!), it’s here that the most iconic photos of Budapest exists, photographed through the arches down to Parliament below, and sitting on the edge of the bastion, with Parliament behind. Given Fisherman’s Bastion is one of the most popular places to visit in Budapest, it gets busy, very quickly. We suggest visiting for sunrise, when the crowds are thin (mostly just Instagrammers!), and the sunrise magical. Alternatively, in summer we suggest visiting in the late afternoon, as you’ll witness an incredible sunset over Pest. If you can avoid it, don’t visit during the day - it’s just too busy. It’s also worth noting that touring outside the visiting hours (early morning, late evening) means entry to the upper Bastion is free. THE DETAILS Where | Budapest, Szentháromság tér Opening Hours | Daily 9 am - 7 pm (can be accessed outside these hours) Cost | HUF 1,000 pp (purchased at the cash machine) Read | Our complete guide to Fisherman‘s Bastion EXPLORE THE HISTORIC JEWISH QUARTER (7TH DISTRICT) Once a dilapidated district riddled with pain and trauma from the atrocities of WW2, the Jewish Quarter of Budapest (Erzsébetváros) is now rapidly gentrifying, home to trendy cafes & restaurants, notorious ruin bars and parties, and incredible street art. Home to Budapest’s Jewish community since the late 1700s, it was also on these very streets that the Jewish Ghetto was placed during WW2, and remnants of this time still exist, including the Synagogue triangle, parts of the ghetto wall, Holocaust memorials, Jewish restaurants and stores. Because of its past, there’s a heap to see and do in the district (read our 7th District guide ), so we highly recommend taking a walking tour of the district, which you can book here . … The starting point is Kiraly Utca, home to hostels, bars, eateries and the infamous Gozdu Udvar, a renovated passageway featuring clubs, bars, and mid-range restaurants offering Hungarian and western fare. it’s popular with tourists, but we recommend exploring further into the district to find the real treats! On Akácfa utca you’ll find the uber-busy Mazel Tov (head to Dobruma instead... trust us), and the party capital of Budapest, Instant/Fogas, where the tunes play till the early hours. Nearby Kazinczy Utca is home to Budapest’s most famous ruin bar, Szimpla Kert , and Karavan, a street-food courtyard with heaps of different fast food options. For somewhere more relaxed, head to our favourite bar in Budapest, Köleves Kert, a garden cum bar that has vibes for days in summer. There’s also the Kazinczy Utca Synagogue, one of three in the district. Hipsters flock to Madach Imre Ter, a square filled with uber-cool bars, cafe’s and shops where Budapest’s creative youth often meet. Telep and Központ are the coolest bars here and don’t forget to grab incredible Neapolitan-style pizza at Moto. Close by is Rumbach Synagogue, the second of the glorious Jewish places of worship. Back towards Wesselenyi Utca is the Great Synagogue (see above), Europe’s largest and most beautiful. Further up the street is Arán Bakery, maybe the best in Budapest and perfect for a quick snack on the go. The district is also home to many of the best brunches in Budapest , including Cirkusz, Dorado (also great for coffee), Stika, Vinyl & Wood. The 7th District can get a little (read very!) touristy, so if you’re after somewhere more local where the local hipsters and students frequent, head across to the stunning 8th District . It’s probably our favourite district in Budapest, home to some of our favourite cafe’s, bars, and buildings. THE DETAILS Where | Budapest Jewish Quarter Plan | Our guide the Budapest’s Jewish Quarter , The best brunch in Budapest , Our guide to Budapest’s Hipster 8th District , How to visit Dohany St Synagogue BOOK | A guided walking tour of the Jewish District THE GREAT SYNAGOGUE OF BUDAPEST The centre point of Jewish culture and indeed modern Jewish history in Hungary is the Dohany Street Synagogue (the Great Synagogue - book your guided tour here ). Inaugurated in 1859, Dohany Street Synagogue is the largest in Europe , and the second-largest in the world and is located right in the heart of the bustling Jewish Quarter . Its size, however, does not detract from its beauty - it’s quite simply one of the most beautiful structures in all of Budapest. Featuring a breathtaking array of ornate architectural details, elegant brickwork and magnificent stained glass windows, the synagogue is a feast for your eyes (and camera). The outstanding domed towers hint at the building’s Moorish/Oriental design inspirations and are the most emblematic part of the building. … The interior is mysterious, combining Moorish elements, including, the splendid organ, impressive Torah ark, gilded detailing and colourful geometrical paintings. However, while the architecture is stunning, it’s the building’s (and Budapest’s) past that is most intriguing. An important sight for Jewish public life since its inauguration, the Synagogue and surrounding district were at the heart of brutal WW2 atrocities. Hungary joined the Axis in late 1940 in exchange for returned lands lost in the Treaty of Trianon, yet by 1943 the country was keen to side with the Allies, all too aware of the brutal Nazi Germany atrocities. In March 1944, Germany invaded Hungary, and the Nazi’s, aided by the Hungarian Fascists, began to deport Jews and Gypsies to the death camps of Auschwitz. The synagogue serves as both a memorial to the lives (and families) lost in Budapest and beyond, and as a beacon of solidarity and hope. As such, we recommend joining a guided tour of the complex and visiting the various memorials that exist throughout the site, including the Raoul Wallenberg Memorial Park, the Tree of Life sculpture, and the Martyrs' Cemetery.

But what is a ruin bar exactly? After World War 2 and the cold war years, many buildings in the old Jewish Quarter of Budapest were left to rack and ruin. In the early noughties, a number of enterprising individuals began to transform these dilapidated buildings and courtyards into the perfect character-filled underground bars and pubs, or 'romkocsma' - earning them the title of ruin bars/pubs. From the outside they could easily be confused with your average run-down building, inside they’re anything but average, with Szimpla Kert, being the original, and best, ruin bar in Budapest . … The first thing you’ll notice when you step inside the glass doors of Szimpla Kert is darkness. It’s slightly disarming, no matter what time of day it is; as if you’ve stepped into another world. It kind of feels like if the Lost Boys from Peter Pan were to create a bar, this would be the result. Then you’ll notice the eclectic furniture - the art, the colourful neon lights, the disco balls, the 90’s tv’s, the plants hanging from the ceiling. You can even sip a beer in an old Trabant (Soviet car). There are a range of themed bars within Szimpla Kert, ranging from beer, wine and shisha, and the booze is cheap (ish), making it the perfect starting point for a night out in Budapest. One of our favourite things about Szimpla Kert is the awesome Sunday farmer market. Producers from all over descend to sell their wares - mostly locally grown fruit, vegetables and flowers, bread, spreads and cheese (omg the goat’s cheese is to die for), honey etc., as well as some Hungarian street food stalls. If you’re a traveller, we totally recommend buying some bread, local cheeses, and some Hungarian spreads, heading to one of Budapest’s amazing parks (or along the Danube), and having a chilled picnic. Quite simply, you can’t visit Budapest without a drink here - and if you wish to enjoy more Budapest ruin bars, read our guide to the city’s best ruin bars .

Beyond their functionality, these bridges represent so much more to the city. Here are three of our faves: SZECHENYI BRIDGE (CHAIN BRIDGE) When we think of Budapest, it’s of Chain Bridge at dusk, flanked by twinkling lights, with Buda Castle looming behind. It’s simply gorgeous, and the emblem of beautiful Budapest. Commissioned by Istvan Szechenyi to connect Buda with Pest over the mighty Danube, Szechenyi Bridge was built by Scot Adam Clark and opened in 1849 to great fanfare. It has since become a symbol for the city, surviving multiple world wars and political uprisings, to allow locals and tourists alike to switch between the two sides of the city. Beyond its beauty, it’s the perfect place for tourists to get photos of some of Budapest’s iconic sites, including Parliament, Gresham Palace, and Buda Castle. NOTE | Szechenyi Bridge is currently closed for renovations, with plans to reopen in 2023.

If you’re looking for places to visit in Porto, this guide to our favourite things to see and do in Porto has you covered — along with all the essential travel information and tips to help you make the most of your stay! Updated April 2024 After all these years doing what we do, we’re still convinced of one thing: Porto is one of our favourite cities on this side of the hemisphere line. Often referred to as Lisbon’s little sister, the red tile-roofed seaside city of Porto is finally stepping forward to command some well-deserved limelight of her own. Charming, colourful, and beautifully authentic, Portugal’s Unesco-protected northern gem is utterly postcard-perfect; it’s a city made for explorers, weekend visitors, backpackers and photographers alike. A romantic jumble of terracotta roofs spills down towards the bustling Douro River, ancient cobbled laneways twist through the historic centre, and the iconic blue and white azulejos breathe life and history onto the medieval and beaux-arts buildings. From the famous waterfront crowded with trendy cafes and wine cellars (the city’s most famous export) to the soaring Dom Luis I Bridge with views over hilly Ribeira and Vila Nove de Gaia, Porto delights at every turn. Beautiful beaches are a short (somewhat rickety) tram ride away, and the architecture and design are so mesmerising that they even inspired JK Rowling's Hogwarts (read our guide to Livraria Lello bookstore here). From every angle, in every light, Porto is achingly beautiful . More than simply competing in looks though, this cool, understated sibling city hums with creative energy and a burgeoning foodie scene that could take on any of the global heavyweights. In recent years, it has become a hotspot for culture vultures and the culinary-obsessed alike; art galleries and iconic street murals have popped up all over the city and are as much a sumptuous feast for the senses as the many stellar eateries serving up a unique balance of traditional cooking and contemporary flavours. The city also makes for a wonderful jumping-off point to adventures beyond its limits; beautiful beaches can be found at the end of a short, rickety tram ride, and the delights of the Douro Valley are consumed within two hours. Best enjoyed slowly, on foot, Porto is a wonderful place for the curious traveller to stroll through lazily, map-less, discovering little treasures, pockets of beauty, and slices of authentic Portuguese life on every corner.

But here in Porto, where so much of the city’s life exists and thrives along the River Douro’s edge, not taking in the city from the water would be doing a disservice to your time here. Jump aboard this six-bridge Porto city sightseeing boat tour by traditional rabello boat, and learn about the importance of the river to the city while passing many of its famous bridges and landmarks. You'll follow the old route once followed by wine merchants transporting Port from the valley to the cellars, pass under the famous Gustav Eiffel-designed Dom Luis I Bridge, admire the beautiful homes of the Riviera from the water, and (hopefully!) soak up some sun. The Ribeira district also looks wonderful from the water, so be sure to snap up a seat on the edge of the boat. THE DETAILS Where | Rabello boats depart from Ribeira Quay Cost | £12 per person BOOK | Six-bridge Porto city sightseeing boat tour #2 TAKE IN THE VIEWS FROM THE MIRADOURO DA VITÓRIA Surrounded by abandoned buildings, Miradouro da Vitória can look a little sketchy at first glance, but don't let the broken window panes of the building next door fool you. This is arguably one of the most popular places to take in the sunset in Porto. From here, you have postcard-perfect views of the river Douro and the jumble of medieval terracotta rooftops that spill down to it. Some of Porto’s main attractions can also be seen from here, including the Bishop’s Palace, Porto Cathedral, and Dom Luis Bridge. Miradouro da Vitória rises above the Praça da Ribeira neighbourhood on the shores of the river Douro; one of the oldest parts of town with beautiful medieval buildings, twisting cobblestone laneways, and riverfront views — so be sure to spend some time wandering the dimly-lit streets too (more on that below!) THE DETAILS Where | Miradouro da Vitória, R. de São Bento da Vitória 11 Cost | Free #3 EXPLORE THE RIBEIRA, BAIXA AND BOLHAO DISTRICTS The three suburbs of Ribeira, Baixa, and Bolhão make up Porto’s most historic and touristy areas; as a traveller, it’s where you’re likely to spend the majority of your time too. On our visit to Porto, wandering the cute cobblestone streets that weave through these areas was our favourite thing to do in the city. Ribeira, with its rows of colourful houses and riverfront views, is vibrant and bustling, full of cafes, bars, and shops full of locals and tourists alike soaking up the atmosphere and views of the river Douro and famous Dom Luis I Bridge. This is where the river Douro 6-bridge river cruises depart from (they often sell out, so book your ticket ahead of time ), and understandably, tends to also be the busiest part of town. Above the Ribeira are the Baixa and Sé areas, where you'll find most the majority of Porto's best attractions, including Mercado do Bolhão, Majestic Cafe, Rua Santa Catarina, Palácio do Bolsa, and so many more. We’d recommend spending a day (or at least an afternoon) with some good walking shoes, no map or phones, and just getting lost amongst the charm of Porto’s historic areas! Alternatively, join this fantastic Porto walking tour , which will take in all the sites, with expert commentary. READ MORE | The best Porto day tours #4 EAT ALL THE PASTEIS DE NATA AT CONFEITARIA DO BOLHÃO Portugal is the birthplace of one of the best sweet treats you could ever hope to sink your teeth into the small yet mighty Pastel de Nata (Portuguese tart). Impossibly crisp and flakey puff pastry tarts filled with the creamiest of egg custard and dusted with cinnamon, they’re heavenly and utterly addictive. One of the greatest things about being in the home of this delicious treat is that it's not just socially acceptable to devour sugary pastries for breakfast, it's actually expected. No place will help you get your pastry on better than the Confeitaria do Bolhão , the beautiful 120-year-old patisserie serving up Porto's best Portuguese tarts, arrufadas (sweetbread), croissants, and other tempting flakey sweet treats. We’re not ashamed to admit we visited daily for our Portuguese tart hit (hey, we did say they were addictive!), grabbing at least four for breakfast before hitting the road to explore more of Porto. Obviously , we needed the mix of carbs and sugars to see as much of Porto as we could, right?! Jokes aside, do as the locals do and grab a coffee, pick your pastry, and settle into the seating area up the back to enjoy. If you feel like learning to make these little parcels of heaven, this Pastel de Nata cooking class is essential. Spend a day getting to know authentic Portuguese cuisine at a cosy home of a local family. It’s one of the best culturally-immersive Porto day tours . THE DETAILS Where | Confeitaria do Bolhão, R. Formosa 339 Cost | € 0.70 - 1 per pastry BOOK | This Pastel de Nata cooking class #5 EXPLORE PORTO BY TRAM Hopelessly touristy, yet wonderfully fun, travelling aboard Porto’s historic (and cute) tram system is a must. While many travellers associate trams with Lisbon, it was actually in Porto that the first Portuguese tram network was built in 1895. The trams here are amongst the oldest electric transport systems in Europe, and you can still spot the quaint little yellow tram cars trundling along the 3 remaining routes today. Sadly, the popularity of tram travel dropped away in the ‘60s as cars and buses became a faster and more convenient way to navigate the city. For travellers, however, the trams remain a scenic and easy way to explore the city. The #1 tram is probably the most popular tourist route, travelling from the famous, and stunning, Igreja de São Francisco (Church of St Francis) about 20 minutes along the rustic facades of Ribeira to the garden of Passeio Alegre at the mouth of the Douro river in Foz. We also opted for a lesser-known route and jumped on board the circular #22 tram that takes in the Clérigos area (and the iconic Clérigos tower - buy your tickets for the bell tower here ), the bustling Avenida dos Aliados (the Avenue of the Allies), past the beautiful São Bento train station and the vibrant Batalha area with its cafes, museums, shops, and houses. We definitely recommend this route if you're keen to see a lot of Porto’s best things to do on a tight schedule! THE DETAILS Where | Linha 1 tram runs from Infante to Passeio Alegre Park in the Foz district, Linha 22 runs from Batalha in a one-directional loop of central Porto, Linha 18 runs from Museu do Carro Elétrico through the historic centre loops around the grand Hospital Santo Antonio. Cost | Single ticket: €3.50, return: €6.00, Two-day pass: €10, child tickets: €5. These tickets are only for the historic trams, no other transport in Porto. #6 EXPLORE THE MERCADO DO BOLHÃO One of the best things to do in Porto is visit the historic and wonderful Mercado de Bolhao, which has recently undergone a long, and painful restoration process to revive its former beauty. Still marked by the original 19th-century wrought iron gates, this historic marketplace was bustling with stalls selling fresh fruit and vegetables, smoked meats and fresh fish, and delicious bread, cheeses, and local delicacies. At the entrance, buskers played traditional music, while street food stalls wooed locals with wafts of cod, Porto’s favourite dish. It’s a great place for tourists to get a feel for daily life in Porto. THE DETAILS Where | Mercado do Bolhão: Rua Formosa Hours | Mon - Fri: 8:00am - 20:00pm, Sat: 8:00am - 18:00pm, closed Sundays and public holidays #7 VISIT BOLSA PALACE AND MARVEL AT THE INTERIORS The Palácio da Bolsa (Stock Exchange Palace) was built between 1842 to 1910, and pays homage to the city's rich merchants of yesterday and today. Built on the ruins of the cloisters of the St Francis Church of Porto next door, the neoclassical building is where the Portuguese stock exchange once operated. Already beautiful from the outside, the building is absolutely stunning inside too; the intricately designed glass-domed Pátio das Nações (Hall of Nations), the grand Escadaria Nobre (noble staircase), and the Salão Árabe (Arab room) to name a few. If you're keen to explore all of the intricately designed rooms of the Palace, jump on one of the 45-minute guided tours (book here ), which depart from the main entrance every 30 minutes. Note | The Palacio da Bolsa is one of the sites discounted (25% off) if you have a Porto Card THE DETAILS Where | Rua Ferreira Borges Hours | 9:30am – 13:00pm / 14:00pm – 17:30pm Cost | Guided tours cost €11.00 for adults, students + seniors: €7.5, children under 12: free. You can also save 25% off entry with your Porto Card BOOK | This must-do guided Palacio da Bolsa tour #8 GRAB LUNCH AT RIBEIRA SQUARE In the day and age of insta-itineraries and extensive ’things to do’ lists (of which we’re well aware we’ve written and you’re currently reading!), it’s easy to forget the joy of spontaneity when travelling. During one of our afternoons in Porto , we sat down for a quick meal and cheeky sangria in Praça Ribeira . The mood was perfect - sun-filled streets, scores of people enjoying themselves, and a Charlie Chaplin impersonator who was actually entertaining to watch. Three hours later, accidentally tipsy on white sangria and full of laughter, we stumbled off to explore more of the Porto. This is probably one of the only times we'll ever recommend an overly touristy area to you, but the general vibe around this square is too good to pass up in this case! Grab yourself lunch (and some sneaky white Sangria) at one of the many cafes lining Praça Ribeira (Ribeira Square). And actually, while you're at it - why stop at one sangria? Grab another and enjoy the midday sun. THE DETAILS Where | Ribeira Square #9 WATCH THE SUNSET FROM THE DOM LUIS I BRIDGE Sunsets in Porto are absolutely magical, so make your way up to the famous Dom Luis I Bridge, designed by Gustav Eiffel, and watch the magnificent spectacle over the Ribeira District. The bridge, ranked #1 for things to do in Porto on Tripadvisor , becomes the heart and soul of the city in the late afternoon, as locals and tourists alike come out to walk and cycle along the bridge or simply take in the views. THE DETAILS Where | Dom Luis I Bridge #10 VISIT LIVRARIA LELLO, PORTO'S MOST BEAUTIFUL LIBRARY It's said to be the most beautiful bookstore in the world and having wandered through it ourselves, we can tell you that Livraria Lello (read our guide here ) definitely lives up to its reputation. Designed by Francisco Xavier Esteves in a Neo-Gothic style, the bookstore was officially inaugurated by the Lello brothers in 1906. With intricately carved gothic wood-panelling, a grand curving staircase, floor-to-ceiling bookshelves, and a stained - glass skylight, it's definitely been wowing visitors ever since. The splendour of Livraria Lello also has another (massive) claim to fame too - rumour has it that the bookstore (along with some key spots in Scotland) inspired the magic of JK Rowling's Hogwarts after she spent 2 years living in Porto teaching English. It definitely feels as though you might bump into Harry or Ron amongst these shelves! If you’re keen to delve further into the secret history of Harry Potter in Porto, this 3-hour Harry Potter tour with Skip-the-line access at Livraria Lello is absolutely worth it. You’ll see the cafe where JK Rowling penned the beginning of the series and some of the places that served as inspiration for her novels. Note | With this notoriety has come global acclaim, and the library is now a more crowded theme park than a quiet space. Has its lustre diminished? Well, given you have to pay and queue to enter, perhaps somewhat. But it’s still an insanely beautiful place to visit in Porto. THE DETAILS Where | Livraria Lello, Rua das Carmelitas Cost | €5 entry (redeemable with any book purchase), purchased online or at the ticket shop a few doors down Book | 3-hour Harry Potter and Livraria Lello tour Read | Our Guide to Livraria Lello #11 ENJOY PORT IN PORTO Port is, unsurprisingly, Porto’s most popular export. The Douro Valley has a long and esteemed history of Port production dating back to the 17th century. Today, the region is protected as the only true Port wine producer in the world. Unsurprisingly, that means that the sweet fortified wine you might have associated with the after-dinner tipple of your grandparents is a very proud favourite on everyone’s wine lists here. A visit to the famed wine cellars is one of the best things to do in Porto, and the most prestigious and celebrated Houses can be found by crossing the Dom Luis I Bridge to the Vila Nova de Gaia side. Start at the innovative Porto Cruz Space , a 5-story building celebrating Porto's unique wine culture and history. Moving through the different floors, there are 3D wine-making games, interactive exhibits on the Douro Valley, wine tastings with a Sommelier, and even a Terrace bar with stellar 360* views of the city on the top floor! It's a must-do for anyone with an interest in Port wine or learning more about Porto's traditional culture too. From there, take your pick of the Wine Houses! There are plenty that line the banks of the River Douro, and you could easily wander between them all. We recommend Kopke Port House (the oldest), Cálem, and Caves Ferreira to get you started! TOUR | We always feel that exploring the food and wine scene of a place requires a local-led tour, and that’s especially true when it comes to Porto’s Port wine culture. This 3-hour Port wine tour + tastings take in some of Porto’s oldest and most esteemed Port houses, with a local guide who can give you the inside word on them all. Keen to expand your knowledge even further? Take this full-day tour of the Douro Valley , which includes Port and olive tastings, a traditional Portuguese lunch, and a Douro River cruise. Alternatively, do what we did and settle in by the fire at one of the many cosy wine bars around the city and discover this delicious wine a little better. THE DETAILS Where | Vila Nova de Gaia BOOK | 3-hour Port wine tour , or full-day tour of the Douro Valley (including tastings) #12 CHECK OUT THE VIEWS FROM CLERIGOS TOWER For centuries, Porto's Torres do Clérigos (Clérigos Tower) has been one of the city's most recognisable landmarks, towering over the city from its place atop the Clérigos Church since 1763. These days, visitors can still access the top of the bell tower via the 230 stairs (aka a very narrow, very claustrophobic and cramped staircase!), the top of which provides epic panoramic views over Porto and beyond. Try to time your visit around the hourly bell chimes through - the cramped nature of the tower means that if you’re caught unawares when the bells begin to chime you might get quite the fright! THE DETAILS Where | Torres do Clérigos, Rua de Sao Filipe de Nery Opening hours | 9:00 am - 19:00 pm every day Cost | €6pp at the entrance (50% discount available to those with the Porto Card ), or get skip the line access by purchasing in advance online here #13 SPOT PORTO’S MANY AMAZING AZULEJO TILES Telling you to go to Porto and spot the many beautiful blue and white azulejo tiles is a little silly, considering a) they’re everywhere, and b) they’re one of the most famous things to see in Porto - but we’d also feel a little silly not including it, considering they’re one of the things that makes Portugal’s northern city so special! First brought to Portugal from Spain (Seville) in the 15th century by King Manuel I, azulejos had actually been a common design feature on the Iberian Peninsula since the Middle Ages. Brought by invading Moors centuries before, their name stems from the Arabic al zulaycha , “the polished stone”, and initially they were very simple geometric shapes. Over time, and as they were adopted more widely in Portugal throughout the 16th and 17th centuries, the tiles began to depict the stories of Portugal’s trials and triumphs, religious stories, and cultural events. Today, they’re a fascinating record of history, culture, and people as well as a beautiful way to decorate blank spaces on buildings. While the tiles are very much a ubiquitous feature of the city, we recommend setting aside time to check out the tiles on the following", "images":

Below is our guide to the best things to do in Bologna, as well as essential travel information to make the most of your stay. UPDATED - April 2024 “Bologna is a city you come to be a local, not a tourist,“ This was the advice given to us - by a Bologna local, no less - before our trip to Italy’s famed red city (after our hike through the incredible Emilia Romagna region ), and our curiosity had instantly been piqued. In a time when many of Italy’s most popular destinations are calling for help as they struggle with record-breaking tourist numbers (again) and move toward implementing tourism taxes , it seemed almost impossible that there could still be a place left in the country where an authentic experience was possible. Yet Bologna is very much that place. In our opinion, this is one of Italy’s most unique, beautiful, and underrated cities. Medieval terracotta buildings give the city its nickname, La Rossa, while miles of UNESCO heritage-listed porticoes paint the streets with lights, shadows, and deep architectural perspectives like moving artwork (perfect for street photography!). Under these columns lie hidden galleries and hipster boutiques, hole-in-the-wall bars and groups of students sharing a laugh between classes. It’s also one of Italy’s most progressive cities, with a deeply liberal and politically edgy society, while also securing pride of place as the country’s gastronomic capital (here’s everything you need to know before visiting Bologna !). Not an easy feat in a country so famed for its delicious fare! What’s more, there’s a distinct lack of foreign tourists sharing these beautiful streets with you, which makes for a beautifully authentic, immersive experience. Often overlooked in favour of Italy’s other ‘hotspots ’, if you’re a traveller in search of ‘true Italy’, Bologna has plenty to offer. Here are twelve things you should do on your visit to Bologna.

Edit like us with our European Summers Preset Packs , and mobile video filters , inspired by the warm hues and vibes of summers spent in Europe BOLOGNA TRAVEL GUIDE OVERVIEW WHERE | Emilia Romagna, Italy WHAT TO SEE AND DO | Walk Bologna’s Porticoes, Climb Asinelli Towers, Visit Basilica di San Petronio, The Sanctuary of San Luca, Explore Quadrilatero markets, Step inside the World’s oldest university WHERE TO EAT | Everywhere… Ahime, Oltre, Osteria dell’Orsa, Trattoria da Me, Mercato delle Erbe WHERE TO STAY | Hotel Porta San Mamolo , Canonica Apartments , Dopa hostel HOW TO GET AROUND | The city is very walkable, or via the bus network WHERE IS BOLOGNA? Bologna is the capital city of the Emilia Romagna region of Italy, located in northern Italy. With a population of close to 400,000, it's Italy's 7th largest city. WHEN TO VISIT BOLOGNA? Like most European cities, Bologna comes alive during the warmer months from May - October, when the temperatures are warm and there's barely any rain. The average temperatures during July and August are around 30 degrees, which might be a little too warm to enjoy exploring the city. Therefore, the best time to visit Bologna is during June or September , when the days are long, warm but not stifling! WHERE TO STAY IN BOLOGNA HOTEL As you’d expect, Bologna is filled with hotels to fit all budget requirements, however, we did find hotels were quite expensive in the city, especially when compared to other parts of Italy.

The UNESCO world-heritage-listed porticoes of Bologna were built between the city's prosperous Middle Ages and the early 20th century when the growth of the University created the need for extra space. To avoid having to narrow the streets down to extend the footprint of the university, porticoes were built over the existing walkways - at a height that horses and carts could pass below them - that also created space for extensions to occur on top of them. There are close to 40kms of porticoes throughout the city of Bologna, each with its own unique style and structure. By simply strolling the city's porticoes, it felt like we were getting to know the city and its history, one step at a time. Another great way to see and learn about the porticoes is to take a guided city walking tour - that way you’ll understand their importance and beauty. Locals use the porticoes in different ways, whether it be friends sitting under their arches to have an espresso or smoke, or to walk their dogs in the absence of rain. University students even use them as advertising boards for the latest parties in town. But for us, it was the perfect place to take photos - they're just so picturesque we couldn't put our cameras down (except when it was time for Aperol Spritz). Some of our favourite porticoes were: The porticoes of Piazza Maggiore and the seat of the old University The original wooden porticoes of Via Marsala The porticoes of Piazza Santo Stefano THE DETAILS Where | Everywhere in Bologna!

BOLOGNA TIPS | Read this before you visit Bologna #2 CLIMB TO THE TOP OF BOLOGNA, THE ASINELLI TOWER If the idea of climbing 498 narrow, wooden steps to the top of a 97.2m tall medieval tower (leaning a noticeable 1.3° off-centre) for the best views in Bologna sounds daunting, let us tell you - it is! But the views from the summit of the Asinelli Tower are unequivocally worth it, and watching the sunset high above the red city was one of our favourite things to do in Bologna (read our guide to the Asinelli Towers here ). The twin towers of Bologna, otherwise known as Le Due Torri , are the number one attraction in the city and one of its most commonly recognised symbols. Commenced in the 11th century, the towers were constructed by the prominent Asinelli and Garisenda families as defensive fortifications (and status symbols), strategically placed at the entry point in the city of the ancient Via Emilia (Aemilian Way) to warn off any potential invaders. Curiously, they weren't the only towers in the city; close to 180 towers once dotted the Bologna skyline, a sort of middle-aged Manhattan. To this day, only twenty have survived the ravages of fires, wars and lightning strikes. The panoramic views over the red city are incredible - you can see Bologna in every direction. To the west is the marvellous Piazza Maggiore and Basilica of San Luca, and to the southwest, the ancient Roman road of via Emilia. To the south, the green rolling hills of the Emilia Romagna region . And if you're feeling brave, lean your head over the railing to look down upon the shorter, leaning Garisenda Tower and Piazza de Porta Ravegana below. Entry is €5 per person, which you can book here . Alternatively, join this tour which includes a visit to the Towers, and a food tasting. We recommend booking ahead of time as there are limited numbers allowed per viewing session. Visiting early in the day, or for the last admission time, will provide you with the most comfortable experience.

The city does, after all have the nickname La Grassa (\"the fat one\"), an epithet we made sure we lived by. Quite simply, eating is one of the best things to do in Bologna, and in a country famed for its cuisine, the city reigns supreme as the gastronomic capital of Italy. The first thing to know is that Bologna is the birthplace of bolognese, or tagliatelle al ragù. Secondly, the region of Emilia Romagna is home to the glorious Parmigiano Reggiano, or parmesan, tortellini, tortelloni, mortadella, Parma ham, balsamic vinegar, and many other delicacies. And thirdly, consuming all this incredible food won't break the bank. While in Bologna we recommend trying these essential meals: Tagliatelle al ragù Tortellini in broth Pumpkin Tortelli with parmesan Butter and sage Tortelloni For traditional Bolognesi cuisine, the street of via della Moline offers a large variety of traditional restaurants, all with large terrace areas perfect for summer dining. Our pick of restaurants was Trattoria del Rosso, which served the most impressive tortelloni we had in Bologna. Other traditional restaurants we highly recommend (we’ve tried a LOT!) in the city include: Trattoria da Me Ristorante Da Cesarina Ristorante Alice Trattoria Anna Marie Osteria dell'Orsa However, if you’re after a more hip, modern approach to Bologna’s famous cuisine, the streets off Mercato delle Erbe are filled with uber-cool Italian trattoria serving seriously good food. Ahimé , owned by three young hipsters pushes the envelope via their ethos - opening the door between the garden and the city. Their seasonal produce comes from the local area, yet the dishes are modern, simple, and delicious. Honestly, this was our favourite meal in Bologna, so make sure you book well in advance before visiting Bologna. Nearby is Oltre , another modern restaurant combining fine dining with hipster elements. The food here is simple, pushing the envelope between modern and traditional in a way rarely experienced in the city. Another must visit. For vegetarians, Botanica Lab is our recommendation - they serve ridiculously good vegetarian meals in the coolest space in Bologna. If you're after something a little more hipster (this city is very hip!), the student quarter of Bologna (near Piazza Guiseppe Verdi) was one of our favourite areas for lively bars, cafes and street food markets. Each evening, bars in the area vie for students attention by offering stuzzichini , a complimentary buffet of tapassy nibbles, as long as you enjoy a few alcoholic beverages, which for us was copious amounts of Aperol Spritz (hey, they were cheap!). The food is surprisingly good, with both vegetarian and meat dishes offered. For a more market vibe, check out the streets and laneways of Quadrilatero, just off Piazza Maggiore. If you’re keen to discover more of Bologna’s food culture, this awesome local specialities private food tour takes in the very best of the city’s food secrets, with your own local guide.

Surrounded by some of Bologna's grandest buildings the Basilica di San Petronio, Palazzo dei Notai, Palazzo d'Accursio, Palazzo del Podestà, Palazzo dei Bianchi and the fountain of Neptune, Piazza Maggiore really is the most beautiful European squares we've laid eyes on. But the beauty of Piazza Maggiore lies beyond its attractive facade. For centuries, locals have embraced and enjoyed this space, and it really is the true definition of a public square. In fact, Piazza Maggiore was home to one of Europe’s biggest open-air market until the mid-1800s with products coming from all over the world, which explains how it grew into the meeting spot for locals in the city. We spent many afternoons in Piazza Maggiore doing something we love: people watching. We sat on the stairs of San Petronio watching as cyclists swerved through crowds of rowdy students, tourists posed for selfies in front of timeless architecture, locals enjoyed an espresso and cigarette at shaded cafes, and buskers filled the square with their musical delights. As the sun went down, we watched Piazza Maggiore and its beautiful buildings illuminate, as the noise from crowds reverberated throughout the whole square. It makes for a slightly surreal but seriously alluring experience. Also located on the square is the Fountain of Neptune ( Fontana di Nettuno), one of the icons of Bologna. Completed in 1566 in late Renaissance-style, the fountain depicts the god Neptune, with four ’angels’ placed at the feet of the Neptune, each of which stand for the Ganges, the Nile, the Amazon and the Danube, the rivers of the four continents known at the time. The sheer size and realistic nature of the sculpture and fountain will leave you in awe. Piazza Maggiore is also home to the Bologna Welcome visitor information centre , where you'll find everything to do with the city. We highly recommend joining one of the city walking tours which commence from here (you can book here ), which will take you to all the major cultural attractions in the city, including Piazza Maggiore. The tour gave us such a better understanding of the city, its culture and its people, at which point, everything suddenly made sense! THE DETAILS Where | Piazza Maggiore #5 ADMIRE THE UNFINISHED BEAUTY OF THE BASILICA OF SAN PETRONIO Smack bang in the middle of Bologna, just off Piazza Maggiore, lies one of the city's most important and imposing structures, San Petronio church. Named in honour of the patron of Bologna, Saint Petronius , construction of the basilica started in 1390. Although it was never completed due to a rivalry with Rome (just look at the half marble, half brick facade on the exterior for the proof!), the church evolved through the middle ages to become the structure it is today. Inside, the church has many distinctive qualities which make it one of the most unique we've visited, so it's a definite stop for any Bologna itinerary. These include: The Meridian line | The longest Meridian in the world (67m), created in 1656 by Gian Domenico Cassini. It corresponds to 1/600,000 of the Earth’s circumference and, to this day, it marks the passing of days and seasons, with the sun ray entering from a hole positioned in the vault 27 meters above the ground and hitting precisely the time of year on the line. Ancient Organs | San Petronius is home to the oldest functioning organ in the world, built in 1470 by Lorenzo da Prato. It's also home to another 400 year old organ. The Frescoes | San Petronius features several impressive frescoes, including Giovanni da Modena's scenes of the Last Judgement, and Maometto's 'In Inferno Canto 28' Side chapels | One of the 22 chapels of the basilica, Cappella Bolognini , houses an original depiction of Heaven and Hell, inspired by Dante’s Divine Comedy Fortunately, it’s free to enter the basilica, however if you wish to take photos, it’ll be €2. THE DETAILS Where | Basilica di San Petronio, Piazza Maggiore Cost | Entry is free, however it costs €2 to take photos inside Opening times | Open daily from 07.45am - 14:00pm and 15:00pm - 18:00pm Tips | Cover your shoulders and knees, and remove any hats #6 EXPLORE BOLOGNA’S BEST MUSEUMS Bologna is home to an exceptional array of museums, including Renaissance-era galleries, modern art collections, and vast museums focused on the city’s strong industrial past. In short, there’s something for everyone in the city, so we’ve listed a few of our favourites below: NATIONAL ART GALLERY OF BOLOGNA (PINOCOTECA NAZIONALE) We’re not going to lie - nothing quite compares to the Renaissance masterpieces dotted through Florence and its many galleries, but Bologna is not Florence, and that’s kind of the appeal of the city. And at the National Art Gallery of Bologna, this difference is obvious - it’s quieter, and an altogether more enjoyable experience than the Disneyland crowds of the Uffizi. Located in the 17th-century former Jesuit novitiate of St Ignatius, the gallery houses a superb collection of 13th - 18th century paintings and fundamental works by artists who were in some way related to Bologna and Emilia, most of which are a result of the suppression of church and Napoleon during the Middle Ages and beyond. Most art is religious in nature from the Renaissance, Mannerism and Baroque periods, which in all honestly, can get a little tedious at times, especially for atheists among us. However, it’s easy to appreciate the extraordinary skill of these Italian masters. Some of the recommended pieces include Raphael’s Ecstasy of St. Cecilia, The Visitation by Tintoretto, and Madonna di Santa Margherita by Parmigianino. Overall, the collection can be see in about 2 hours, and information is provided in both Italian and English. Entrance is €6, however is free with the Bologna Welcome card. THE DETAILS Where | Pinacoteca Nazionale di Bologna (National Gallery) Cost | €6 Opening hours | Tuesday, Wednesday: 9am-2pm, Thursday - Sunday and public holidays*: 10 am – 7 pm (last admission 30 mins before closing time). Closed on Monday MUSEUM OF MODERN ART (MAMBO) A little bit tired of all the historical sites of Bologna, we decided to spend an afternoon checking out something a little more modern - Bologna's Museum of Modern Art (MAMbo). Located in a former bread bakery, MAMbo is now a centre for creativity and experimentation, and features permanent and loaned collections set out over 9,500sqm of modern, architecturally fluid floorspace. The permanent collection is organised into nine separate themes spanning from the 20th century to present. Our favourite exhibition was that of Italy's famous still life painter (and Bologna native), Giorgio Morandi. The exhibition features some of his most famous and significant works, and analyses the motifs and periods that characterised Morandi's work. THE DETAILS Where | Museo D'Arte Moderna di Bologna (MAMbo) Cost | €6.00 to permanent collections Opening hours | 10:00am - 18:30pm Tues, Wed, Fri - Sunday (and holidays)Thursday: 10:00am - 22",

Explore Florence's must-visit attractions, as well as essential travel information to make the most of your stay. The cradle of the Renaissance . Home to the most famous pieces of art in the world. Widely regarded as the most beautiful city in Italy . And yet, we didn’t like Florence after our first visit. Unfortunately, some places just don’t vibe. Cape Town , our forever favourite city, exudes natural beauty, endless spirit and exceptional food and wine offerings, but it’s the intangible that makes it utterly perfect - the sunsets, the friends, the markets, the life. In our minds, Florence, while beautiful, was Disneyland. No soul. No life. Attractions to tick off and then move on, let’s get to the Cinque Terre. Five years later, on our second visit, our minds were changed. No, they were shattered. A week spent in the city opened our eyes to what Florence really is. Yes, it’s the cradle of the Renaissance, home to the most famous pieces of art in the world, and one of the most beautiful cities in Italy. But it’s so much more than that. It’s slow sunrise walks on the banks of the Arno. It’s lazy afternoons, Spritz in hand on Piazza Santo Spirito. It’s the best truffle pasta you’ve ever had. It’s truly admiring David and finally understanding why Michelangelo is revered. It’s the afternoon light caressing the Duomo. It’s art, everywhere. It’s sunsets, museums, wine, gelato, finding that perfect leather wallet, the best tour guide… it’s life. Finally, the intangible burned bright in our minds, and Florence finally made sense. This guide on the best things to do in Florence aims to share that sense of wonder. Yes, we feature the main tourist attractions that everyone needs to see and do, but we’ve tried to include a deeper, more curated guide to the city - our personal recommendations found discovering the city on our many long days exploring each corner. From the best things to see, eat and do, plus a selection of our hidden gems, this is our guide to Florence. LOVE OUR PHOTOS?

BOOK | Alfieri9 TOP SIGHTS TO SEE IN FLORENCE WATCH THE SUNSET FROM PIAZZALE MICHELANGELO As the day's warmth mellows into hues of amber and tangerine, we join throngs of travellers and locals alike at Piazzale Michelangelo, each here to witness Florence’s heavenly dance with the setting sun. The iconic dome of the Florence Cathedral stands silhouetted against the sky, watching over the city. The Arno River winds lazily through the city, its waters glistening in the fading light. The Ponte Vecchio stretches gracefully across the river, its shops and houses clinging to its sides like barnacles on a ship's hull. People gather around, sharing this moment, capturing it with cameras, or simply savouring the view, jaw to the floor. Florence's lights begin to twinkle, one by one, like stars in a city made for dreamers. As the sun bids goodbye, Mim whispers in my ear - “I get it now. Florence finally makes sense”. Watching sunset at Piazzale Michelangelo is one of the most popular things to do in Florence, so here’s the practical information to help you enjoy the views for yourself. Firstly, it gets busy… very busy, so we suggest arriving at least an hour before sunset to find your spot. Bring some beers, pack and picnic, and settle in for the show. To get there, we suggest taking the stairs commencing from Piazza Guiseppe Poggi/Porta San Niccolò - it’s a hard slog, but it’ll get you there quickly. Alternatively, take the scenic route through the streets leading to Porta San Miniato, and up the stairs past the Rose Garden. For those short of time, bus routes 12 & 13 take you directly to the square and return to either Santa Maria Novella station via Santa Croce (12), or to Santa Maria Novella station via the Oltrarno district/Boboli Gardens. More info here . THE DETAILS Where | Piazzale Michelangelo, Florence How to get there | Taking the stairs commencing from Piazza Guiseppe Poggi/Porta San Niccolò, or via bus routes 12 & 13 from Santa Maria Novella station via Santa Croce (12), or to Santa Maria Novella station via the Oltrarno district/Boboli Gardens ADMIRE HISTORY’S GREATEST ART IN THE UFFIZI GALLERY Like a Renaissance time-traveller's portal, a walk through the storied corridors of the Uffizi Gallery is an essential thing to do in Florence. One of the pre-eminent art galleries in the world, the Uffizi Gallery was designed in the mid-16th century, originally intended to house the administrative offices (\"Uffizi\" means offices in Italian) of the Florentine government, until the Medici family decided to use this space for their substantial art collection. Under Medici's patronage, it became one of the world's first public museums and led to the belief that art and knowledge would be accessible to all (thanks, guys!). So, on our second visit to Florence, we embraced the Medici ideals and finally entered these hallowed walls. The gallery itself jostles for attention with its most famous pieces. With frescoed walls, marbled stairs, grand halls, and large windows; it’s an inviting space not unlike the Louvre. But we’re here for the art, and we start on the first floor, home to artists like Botticelli, Michelangelo, Raphael, and Titian. We admire Botticelli's famed Primavera, which blooms eternal, capturing the essence of rebirth and transformation. The Birth of Venus is our favourite - a goddess afloat on a scallop shell, hair aflow, and heavenly as the morning mist. Da Vinci's smile in the Annunciation hints at the mysteries of human existence (and there are many), much like Mark’s smile when he’s up to no good. Everywhere we turn, another piece of art from our high school textbooks. Raphael's Madonna of the Goldfinch exudes maternal tenderness, while Caravaggio's chiaroscuro (light & dark) mastery in Medusa leaves us speechless. Michelangelo's Doni Tondo exudes a raw emotion that reverberates through the ages. The highlight, though, is the Tribune, a grand, gilded, room that holds the Medici's most precious works. In the end, we spend over three hours here, slowly making our way through two floors, 45 rooms and 1,500 works of art. Due to its popularity, the Uffizi is understandably busy, so we suggest booking your tickets well in advance, and for the earliest (or latest) time slot possible. You can do so on the official website here. You can also book skip-the-line access to the gallery here . Alternatively, this popular guided tour is well worth the money, providing expert oversight on the works of the Uffizi, and skip-the-line access. THE DETAILS Where | Uffizi Gallery, close to Piazza della Signoria, and Ponte Vecchio Cost | €26 per person (2023). For an additional €4 charge, you can book an advanced ticket for a specific time. However, you still must line up at the ticket office for your printed ticket, which can take time. For fast, skip-the-line entry tickets, book here Opening Hours | From Tuesday to Sunday, 8.15 am to 6.30 pm Tip | Arrive early to avoid crowds. Photography is generally allowed, but the use of flash and tripods is not permitted BOOK | This popular Uffizi Gallery guided tour or skip-the-line entry tickets EXPLORE FLORENCE’S OTHER MUSEUMS Beyond the prestige of the Uffizi, Florence is home to a diverse range of incredible museums that are also worth your time. Below are three additional museums and galleries we suggest to visit. PALAZZO STROZZI In our opinion, Renaissance art, while wonderful, becomes a little same same after a while. There are only so many depictions of religious and mythological scenes that we can see before our minds start to demand something more exciting. Step up Strozzi Palace , Florence’s home of contemporary art. Set in a stunning Renaissance palace commissioned by the wealthy Strozzi family in the 15th century, it now houses an ever-changing array of exhibitions, events, and activities. Its focus is on showcasing contemporary art, including previous exhibitions by modern visionaries such as Ai Wei Wei, Marina Abramović and Jeff Koons, which perfectly contrast with the grand rooms of the Palace. The palazzo's open courtyard and imposing exterior make it a fitting setting for art exhibitions that seamlessly merge the historical and the modern in Florence. In our opinion, you can’t miss visiting. PALAZZO PITTI Set in a grand Renaissance palace that was the former residence of the Medici family, the imposing Pitti Palace houses an interesting collection of art that spans centuries and genres. The palace interiors are lavishly decorated with opulent furnishings, tapestries, and artwork. However, it’s an extensive collection of art that is worth a visit. There are several museums within the Palace, including the Palatine Gallery, which showcases an incredible collection of paintings by artists such as Raphael, Titian, and Rubens. The Royal Apartments, where the former Medici living quarters have been preserved, offer an interesting glimpse into their opulent lifestyle. The Gallery of Modern Art and the Costume Gallery exhibit more recent art and fashion, adding a contemporary touch to the palace's historical pieces. The Palace is also home to the Boboli Gardens, a sprawling Renaissance garden adorned with sculptures, fountains, and elegant landscaping (more on that below). We suggest visiting both, although if you’re only in Florence for a short time, prioritise visiting the gardens. BARGELLO MUSEUM Oft-overlooked, the Bargello Museum is a hidden gem that holds a wealth of Renaissance art and sculptures Housed within a 13th-century fortress, the exterior is imposing, however, the museum is renowned for its impressive collection of sculptures by revered artists such as Donatello, Michelangelo, and Giambologna. Donatello's bronzed depiction of David, with its feminine form and curiosity, is the best piece that adorns the museum's halls. Additionally, the Museum showcases a diverse array of artefacts, including ceramics, tapestries, and Islamic art. Overall though, unless you’ve got time, or are an art aficionado, we’d prioritise the Uffizi and Strozzi Palace. BOOK | Pitti Palace skip-the-line ticket s, Bargello Museum entrance tickets SAY HELLO TO THE MESMERISING DAVID Mark likes to think he once looked like David - curly hair, chiselled abs, small… legs. Alas, those days are long gone, but for over 500 years, David has never diminished, his perfect form immortalised in marble for the world to admire. Housed in Florence's Accademia Gallery, David is one the most famous pieces of art in the world, a solitary figure of awe-inspiring grace and grandeur, the young shepherd turned symbol of Renaissance might. Chiselled from an imperfect block of Carrara marble by Michelangelo, each contour is a testament to human potential, perfection, and grace. All the things Mark is not. His gaze, unwavering and resolute, seems to penetrate the depths of your soul. The sculpture is so lifelike that its veins seem to pulse with life, and its muscles appear ready to spring into action. The masterful details - the intricate curls of hair, the sinews of his neck, the veins coursing beneath his skin, that butt… It’s hard to fathom such perfection, but here it is, right in front of you, carved from a single bloody piece of marble. How, we ask ourselves, over and over and over? While most people come, snap a photo and move on, we suggest spending at least 30 mins - 1 hour admiring his form. Beyond David, the rest of the Accademia Gallery is worth your while, filled with a wonderfully diverse array of artworks spanning centuries and styles, over four centuries worth of sculptures, including Michelangelo's unfinished works, and a range of musical instruments that belonged to the grand dukes of Tuscany. THE DETAILS Where | Galleria dell'Accademia di Firenze (just look out for the crowds) Cost | €13 per person. Book tickets well in advance (or book a guided tour) Opening Hours | Tues - Sun, 8:15 am to 6:50 pm - last admissions at 6:20 pm. Closed on Mondays BOOK | This in-depth guided tour of the Accademia & David WALK ACROSS THE HISTORIC PONTE VECCHIO It’s a testament to a city’s grandeur that even a bridge is considered a masterpiece, but that’s Florence for you. A timeless icon of the city, Ponte Vecchio (old bridge) traverses the Arno River providing passage for Florentines since the 14th century. Connecting Piazza del Duomo, Piazza della Signoria on the historical side with the area of Palazzo Pitti and Santo Spirito in the Oltrarno, it has stood the test of time (it somehow survived the destruction of World War II). Believed to date back to Roman times, this three-arch medieval bridge features a unique covered passageway, originally home to a variety of merchants, including butchers, tanners, and blacksmiths. In 1593, Grand Duke Ferdinando I de' Medici decreed that only goldsmiths and jewellers were allowed on the bridge (can you imagine the smell of the butchers and tanners?!), an understandable tradition that continues to this day. As you walk across the bridge, and you will, probably multiple times a day, you’ll notice the intricately designed gold and silver adornments displayed in charming boutiques. From stunning engagement rings to finely crafted necklaces, each piece is a testament to Florence's long artistic legacy. But they come at a price - and on our blogger budgets, we gave them a miss. In the middle of the bridge though, are viewing platforms offering stunning views of Florence’s riverside and adjacent bridges - we suggest, like always, making your way here around dusk to enjoy the golden hues lighting up the Arno and surrounding buildings. Overall though, it is just a bridge, and after your first (and maybe second) wander, it’ll serve its function of getting you from A to B - hence we suggest taking a sunset boat road along the Arno to gain a more detailed perspective (see below). THE DETAILS Where | Ponte Vecchio, Florence ADMIRE THE EXPANSIVE PIAZZO DELL SIGNORIA & PALAZZO VECCHIO If we’re being completely honest, Piazza dell Signoria isn’t our favourite part of Florence - we’d much prefer to spend a lazy afternoon sipping Spritz on Piazza Santo Spirito in Oltarno than be caught amongst the snap-happy throngs that descend on the square here. Nonetheless, a visit to Piazza della Signoria and its magnificent centrepiece, Palazzo Vecchio , is still an essential thing to do in Florence, especially for first-time visitors keen to understand more about Florence, and of course to admire the exceptional open-air museum. From the Roman era to the Renaissance and beyond, this piazza is where Florentine history, art, and life intertwine, and it’s these same cobblestones that have supported the weight of Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, and Dante. It’s here that locals congregated to enforce political change, and where the infamous Bonfire of the Vanities occurred, a purging of the city’s ‘sinful’ objects including books, paintings and more. The spot where fires burned is now marked by a bronze plaque embedded in the ground. Nowadays, the piazza is a meeting point for locals and (mostly) tourists, keen to enjoy Florence’s open-air gallery. The epicentre is Ammannati’s 16th-century masterpiece, The Fountain of Neptune - a symbol of Florence's mastery of art and water. There’s also a replica of Michelangelo’s David, for those who can’t make the Accademia. To the right of the square is the iconic 14th-century Loggia dei Lanzi, an open-air museum that houses an exceptional collection of sculptures. Iconic works, such as Benvenuto Cellini's Perseus with the Head of Medusa and Giambologna's Rape of the Sabine Women, find their home here. Gazing over the square is the early-Renaissance wonder of Palazzo Vecchio, Florence's historic town hall and medieval palace that houses treasures such as the Salone dei Cinquecento (Hall of the Five Hundred) and the private chambers of the Medici family. Since 1872, it has housed the office of the mayor of Florence, and it is the seat of the City Council, however, you can still climb the palace’s tower , which gives the best panoramic view of the city (although Ghiotto’s tower and Brunelesschi’s Dome say hi). If you’re keen to learn more about Florence’s history, including a visit to Piazza dell Signoria and Palazzo Vecchio, we highly suggest this walking tour. THE DETAILS Where | Piazza dell Signoria & Palazzo Vecchio BOOK | Palazzo Vecchio skip-the-line entry GET LOST IN FLORENCE’S HISTORIC QUARTER A labyrinth of enchanting streets and alleys shrouded in hues of ochre and amber, Florence’s historic quarter is a wonder to stroll aimlessly. There are treasures on just about every corner, from Renaissance Palazzos to hidden local markets, astoundingly good sandwich shops to the ubiquitous wine windows. Indeed, it was during our early morning photography walks that we truly understood the beauty of this city. The empty Piazza del Duomo, where tolling bells echo endlessly. The imposing Florence Cathedral juxtaposed with the well-dressed cyclist on the way to work. The stillness of the Arno as you walk across Ponte Vecchio. The cobbled medieval laneways were illuminated by the morning light. The gilded café serves Italy’s finest coffee to in-the-know Florentines. A living, breathing city steeped in tradition. We recommend getting lost early before Florence wakes up. Start your stroll in Piazza dell Signoria. Head west, toward Piazza di Santa Trinita, lined by Gothic & Renaissance-era palaces and the stunning Basilica di Santa Trinita. Continue west towards Piazza Goldoni, before heading north through the narrow alleyways towards Piazza di Santa Maria Novella. Head east, towards the Duomo and surrounding streets, each providing a more striking view of the cathe", "images":

{"url": "https://www.thecommonwanderer.com/blog/best-things-to-do-in-paris", "title": "Exploring the City of Lights: our favourite things to do in Paris | The Common Wanderer", "publish_date": "Jul 17", "text": "Exploring the City of Lights: our favourite things to do in Paris France Europe Jul 17 Written By The Common Wanderer There's probably no city in the world quite as magical as the City of Lights! If you're looking for cool or interesting things to do in Paris, here are our favourite ways to spend time in the French capital. Ahh, Paris. The city of light. The city of love. The city that needs no real introduction. For centuries, the French capital has enticed eager-eyed travellers from around the globe, hoping to acquaint themselves with its wide boulevards, romantic Belle Époque architecture, and deliciously flakey pastries. We have to admit to being amongst those travellers on more than one occasion. While others may visit once and be satisfied, or write it off as ‘too big’, ‘too cliche’, ‘too done’; there’s just a certain je ne sais quoi about this city that just keeps calling us back, and a city you should include in any Europe itinerary . The call is so strong, in fact, that between us we’ve been back to wander the streets of Paris 9 times - the most recent, an early summer adventure with Air France (if you’re visiting in the cooler months, read this Paris in winter guide!). Somehow, through all those visits, that feeling of awe and wonder that we first arrived into the city with has never left us, and we're still finding exciting new things to do in the city with every visit! From a retro sidecar tour to lunch in the sun at one of Paris’ green spaces, these are our favourite things to do in Paris. WATCH OUR LATEST PARIS VIDEO BELOW THE BEST THINGS TO DO IN PARIS - #1 - FLY THE FRENCH WAY Start your trip in style by travelling the French way with Air France . From dropping off our luggage easily at Heathrow to enjoying our fresh croissant and coffee on board, it couldn’t have been a more perfect start to our week in Paris! Also, for those who love the feel of a thick, beautifully designed magazine in their hands, you need to check out Air France's magazine whilst on board - it gave the two of us magazine nerds some serious feels. - #2 - STAY IN A CHIC PARISIAN HOTEL Nothing says Parisian chic like a sophisticated hotel, right? Welcome to the Hoxton Paris . Set in a historic 18th century mansion classified as a monument historique , this hotel is undoubtedly the most beautiful place we’ve ever stayed. From the cobblestone and glass entrance way to the plush statement furniture and wooden chevron-patterned floors; it’s contemporary but quaintly charming, nostalgic but uber trendy, and basically, every interior design goal we have for our future home. Seriously, just look at the photos below (and read our review of our stay here ). The Hoxton is located in the happening 2nd arrondissement, and basically within walking distance of all the major attractions, metro stations, and fab restaurants - though you probably won’t want to leave the beautiful hotel restaurant to go anywhere else! THE DETAILS Location | 30-32 Rue de Sentier, Paris Reviews of the Hoxton Paris | See what other travellers thought of the Hoxton Paris on Tripadvisor now CHECK CURRENT PRICES AND AVAILABILITY FOR THE HOXTON ON BOOKING.COM NOW hipster dreaming: our stay at the beautiful Hoxton Paris - #3 - SEE THE SIGHTS If you go to Paris and you don’t get a photo under the Eiffel Tower or pinching the top of the Louvre pyramid… Did you even go to Paris at all?! Seriously though, there’s a reason that this city’s landmarks are adored throughout the world. They’re spectacular, and even after as many visits as we’ve made they still give us all the happy feelings every time we see them. Be sure to schedule ample time for sightseeing the major players; the Eiffel Tower, Arc De Triomphe, Champs Elysees, Sacre Coeur, Notre Dame - and then schedule a little extra for the many return visits you’ll definitely want to make to see them again! Tours are a great way to see all the sights, especially if your time is limited - our use this two-day Paris itinerary to make the most of your time. Click here to search and book some of Paris' most popular tours (many of which we've done and enjoyed!). - #4 - WANDER THE COLOURFUL, PRETTY STREETS If we asked you to think of a Parisian street, chances are an image of wide leafy boulevards and ornate buildings topped with slate grey roofs are what comes to mind. That image would be pretty accurate in most cases too. Most, but not all. See, hidden around corners and down quiet laneways are a few streets rebelling against the ‘typical’ French style we all think we know. Instead, streets like Rue Cremieux, with its quiet row of charming pastel houses framed by cute shutters, window boxes and lush pot plants, will have you wondering if you’ve taken a wrong turn somewhere and ended up back in London’s Notting Hill. We recommend visiting in the early morning to avoid the hordes of tourists, but do be mindful that it’s a residential area too so keep noise down and be respectful. In the quiet of dawn during our visit, shutters were thrown open, while the sounds of families getting ready for the day and the scent of breakfast began to waft through the streets. A perfect and unique insight to this little corner of Paris! To find Rue Cremieux, click here . - #5 - TAKE A BATEAUX PARISIENS CRUISE What better way to see all the beautiful bridges of Paris than by cruising underneath them?! Your Bateaux cruise will wind along the river Seine, taking in all of Paris’ most enchanting sites from an entirely new angle, and without having to navigate through the crowds of people on the streets. On a warm summer evening the river banks are jovial with groups enjoying picnics and making the laidback Parisian life too. You can opt for a simple daytime cruise, or book onto one of their lunch or dinner options for a special occasion. We actually opted for a Bateaux Parisiens dinner cruise on our recent visit, and enjoyed a magical evening (and 3-course meal!) as the city of lights began to sparkle all around us. THE DETAILS Hours | 10:00am - 10:30pm every day Location | Bateaux Parisiens cruises depart from Port de la Bourdonnais Cost | Sightseeing cruises from EU15, Dinner cruises from EU59 Book your Bateaux Parisiens Sightseeing Cruise | Quick-entry cruise tickets can be booked here Book your Bateaux Parisiens Dinner Cruise | 3-course dinner cruise with live music can be booked here Review of the Bateaux Parisiens | See what other travellers thought of the Bateaux Parisiens here dreaming of summer? why menorca should be your next summer escape - #6 - ADMIRE ALL THE ART Paris is a city made for art-lovers, and there's definitely a gallery to suit every taste. Make time for the obvious tourist magnets, the Louvre and Musee D’Orsay - their stunning architecture and history is worth making the visit for alone! - but also make time for the modern art collection at the Centre Pompidou, as well as the huge number of independent art galleries around the city. Air France's Travel Guide to Paris is also a great resource for discovering independent and interesting galleries too - like the Museum of Perfume! Be sure to check it out for your next visit to Paris. Get your timing right and you might also be able to visit some of the best museums and galleries for free with the ‘free first Sundays’ initiative too. - #7 - ENJOY THE GREEN SPACES OF PARIS For all that Paris is a bustling metropolis, it’s also a city that takes pride in its green spaces . You only need to admire the paintings of some of France’s most popular artists to realise just how adored their parks and gardens truly are. The Tuileries Garden , once the 16th-century palace garden of France’s last royals, is the most lavish and elaborate of them all, with carefully manicured gardens and grand sculptures by Rodin. A walk through this park feels a world away from the craziness of the Champs Elysées just a stone’s throw away! On warm days, Parisians also know how to make the best use of these spaces, arriving at Places des Vosges or the Jardin de Luxembourg armed with picnic baskets full of gourmet treats to share with loved ones. Get into the spirit by joining them, or simply take a stroll through the lush surroundings. improve your mobile photography game - our step by step guide to taking amazing smartphone photos - #8 - SEE PARIS THE RETRO WAY Having now seen Paris a few times, we were really keen to explore the city from a totally new perspective. Enter: Retro Tours and their motorbike sidecar tours of Paris. Wizzing about the cobblestone streets of Paris on the back of a vintage motorbike and sidecar, with a charming local guide (dressed in equally charming retro motorbiking gear) - honestly, we can’t even begin to tell you how good this tour was. The guys who founded Retro Tours wanted to create a company that shows off Paris, but in an authentic way. So while you’ll rumble down the Champs Elysees and around the Eiffel Tower, your guide will also show you ‘his Paris’; a favourite street, a local market, a pretty building. All the things that these Paris-born guides love the most about their city. We had previously marvelled at the organised chaos of the Arc de Triomphe’s traffic from a safe vantage point atop the arch itself; but to be in the thick of one of Europe’s busiest roundabouts with this beautiful monument at its centre was truly exhilarating. Come to Paris, book this sidecar tour , have the best hour of your entire trip. Simples. If you’re looking for more tours, including some of the best day trips from Paris , check out this guide . THE DETAILS Retro Tours | Classic tour, 40 minutes, from EU69, Great Escape, 1.5 hours, from EU169, Paris by Night, 1.5 hours, from EU209, Tailor Made tours, from 3.5 - 7hours, from EU369 Book your Retro Tour | Check dates and availability for the classic sidecar motorbike tour here Reviews of the Retro Tours Sidecar Tour | Check other travellers reviews of Retro Tours here - #9 - IMMERSE YOURSELF AT ATELIER DES LUMIERES Atelier des Lumieres is the future of art. There simply isn’t another way to explain what this incredible, immersive new gallery is. An old factory reborn into new life, an immersive 360* art installation that projects the work of artists onto every wall, ceiling, and human limb in the airy space, and a specially curated soundtrack to tie it all together: it’s a sensory feast that leaves you transfixed from the minute you step inside. At the moment, a Kli We could have sat on that floor, utterly mesmerised by those beautiful artworks coming to life all around us for hours, if not days. When we arrived for our session there were people eveeerywhere - so be sure to book your tickets ahead of time to save having to stand in a lengthy queue. THE DETAILS Opening hours | Sun - Thurs: 10:00am - 18:00pm, Fri & Sat: 10:00am - 22:00pm Location | 38 Rue Saint-Maur, Paris Atelier des Lumieres entrance fee | Full price: EU14.50 Reviews | See what other travellers thought of Atelier des Lumieres on Tripadvisor here - #10 - PÈRE LACHAISE CEMETERY Yes, we’re recommending you visit a Parisian cemetery - and no, we haven’t lost the plot! Since 1804, Pére Lachaise (also known as ‘cemetery of the vanities’) has been the final resting place of more than a million people in over 70,000 tombs. What’s more, it’s one of the most peaceful and beautiful places we’ve visited in Paris. Hundreds of celebrities, writers, artists, and musicians are buried in this beautiful, tree-lined cemetery; author Oscar Wilde, composer Frederic Chopin, cabaret singer Edith Piaf, mime Marcel Marceau and Jim Morrison, the forever 27-year-old lead singer of The Doors amongst them. The tombs are elaborate and breathtaking, and the tranquil green grounds (the largest in Paris!) thrive with the new life of sweetly singing birds and beautiful wildflowers. THE DETAILS Opening hours | Mon - Fri: 08:00am - 18:00pm Sat: 8:30am - 18:00pm Sun: 9:00am - 18:00pm Location | 16 Rue du Repos, Paris - ESSENTIAL INFORMATION FOR YOUR TRIP TO PARIS - - USE THE AIR FRANCE TRAVEL GUIDE TO PARIS Thanks to Air France's Travel Guide to Paris , we were able to plan our perfect week in the city. The guide is packed with the perfect mix of well-known Paris spots, and some off-the-beaten-track local tips (like visiting the Père Lachaise cemetery!). Be sure to check it out when you're planning your next trip to the city of lights! - HOW TO GET TO/FROM PARIS Why wait till you’re already on the ground to begin your dream Paris holiday?! Start your trip in style by travelling the French way with Air France . From dropping off our luggage easily to enjoying our fresh croissant and coffee on board (with one of the most beautiful airline magazines we’ve ever seen to keep us entertained!), it couldn’t have been a more perfect start to our week in Paris! - HOW TO GET AROUND PARIS We found the best way to get around Paris was by using the Paris Pass Lib card . The Paris Pass Lib card allows you to travel Paris at your own pace, with a 1 to 5-day Passlib.

Discover the best things to do, Tórshavn’s hidden attractions, the most delicious local food, and where to stay in the city, with our guide! Let’s be honest, if you’re planning a trip to the Faroe Islands , you’re probably most interested in the archipelago’s spectacular landscapes. Off-the-beaten-track islands, unique wildlife and some of the world’s best photography opportunities ; the rugged and wild scenery is some of the most stunning we’ve ever seen. But a day exploring the country’s small and quirky capital, Tórshavn, is well worth your time. Tórshavn is located on the south-east coast of the island of Streymoy, and is home to around 20,000 inhabitants, all of whom seem very proud to live in one of the smallest capitals in the world! While it might not be the most buzzing capital in Europe - we actually think this is part of its appeal - there’s a great mix of cultural heritage, hipster cafes, photogenic harbours and fun day-tours to enjoy. What’s more, its culinary scene is modern and progressive, leading to an exceptional array of restaurants. Whether you’re basing your Faroes adventures from here, or making a quick pit-stop, here’s our guide to Tórshavn, including our personal recommendations on what to see, eat and do, and where to stay. TÓRSHAVN TRAVEL GUIDE ESSENTIALS TÓRSHAVN HIGHLIGHTS | Tinganes, Nolsoy, Vestaragág, KOKS, National Gallery of the Faroe Islands WHERE TO STAY | Hotel Tórshavn , Havgrim Seaside Hotel HOW LONG TO SPEND IN TÓRSHAVN | 1 day, or base yourself here while exploring WHEN TO VISIT? | Summer (June - August) CURRENCY| The Faroese Króna and the Danish Krone WHERE TO STAY IN TÓRSHAVN Given its size (or lack thereof), Tórshavn isn’t blessed with a huge array of accommodation options. However, there are a couple of well-appointed hotels located right in the thick of the action. We recommend staying downtown, just off the harbour and exploring the best things to do in Tórshavn from there. HOTELS IN TÓRSHAVN We based ourselves in Tórshavn for most of our time in the Faroes, in two separate locations, and can highly recommend both: Hotel Tórshavn , right in the centre of town - a clean, basic hotel and good base for exploring, best for those on a tighter budget. BOOK | Hotel Tórshavn Havgrim Seaside Hotel - a beautiful little boutique hotel that's been around since 1948 but recently refurbished. It's just past the harbour, with some pretty epic sea views. And a deliciously tasty breakfast buffet (excuse us while we drool a little!). BOOK | Havgrim Seaside Hotel You can also search alternative hotels and prices on Booking.com HOSTELS IN TÓRSHAVN Hostels are few and far between in the Faroes, and there’s pretty much only one in Tórshavn itself. In our opinion, what you get for what you pay (normally £75+!) isn’t necessarily worth it. That said, we recommend 62N Guesthouse if you’d like BOOK | 62N Guesthouse THINGS TO DO IN TÓRSHAVN EXPLORE THE HISTORIC TINGANES DISTRICT OF TÓRSHAVN No trip to Tórshavn (and indeed the Faroes) is complete without a visit to Tinganes, the city's historic old town dating all the way back to the 1400s. Postcard-perfect, but thoroughly different to your usual European ‘old town’, we recommend taking a stroll through the narrow, winding lanes and passageways filled with quintessential Faroese houses - charming grass-roofed, black-timber and stone buildings still used by locals today. Tinganes is also home to one of the oldest parliamentary meeting locations in the world, where the Viking parliament first met in the 900s, and is still home to the Prime Minister’s office today. It’s possible to take a tour of the Parliament building which can be organised at the centrally located Visitors Centre (located at Niels Finsens gøta). A short walk from Parliament Point is Vestaravág, the colourful harbour area of Tórshavn, and home to a number of great restaurants, including Skeiva Pakkhus , which serves super modern Faroese cuisine in a tapas-like format. Make sure you try the smoked salmon, which in this part of the world, is absolutely incredible. It’s also worth checking out the historic Tórshavn Cathedral (Dómkirkjan), which was constructed in 1609, and Skansin, Tórshavn's old fort which dates back to 1580. Although not a lot remains today, it does provide a nice view out to Nolsoy, and back panoramic views towards Tinganes and the rest of Tórshavn. THE DETAILS Where | Tinganes, Tórshavn read more | what to know before visiting the faroe islands TAKE A BOAT TOUR OF TÓRSHAVN HARBOUR If you’re keen to explore Tórshavn from a different perspective, we suggest jumping aboard Egholm, a traditional Faroese boat , and exploring the colourful harbour and surrounds. Leaving from Bryggjubakka in Vestaravág harbour , the tour takes in many of the Tórshavn main attractions from the water, including the pretty red buildings of Tinganes. From here, the tour heads south towards Sandagerð beach and the undisturbed coastline south of the Argir district. It’s a great way to get to see more of the capital and learn more about the Faroe Islands’ long nautical heritage. Additionally, the tour is sustainable and eco-friendly; the traditional boat has been converted to electricity, meaning there is little noise and pollution. Winning. THE DETAILS Where | Departs from Vestaravág harbour Cost | £24 (200 DKK) Availability | June - October BOOK | Tórshavn Harbour Roundtrip SHOP FOR TRADITIONAL FAROESE WOOLLEN JUMPERS On the Faroe Islands, wool is gold. At least that’s what the Faroese proverb, \" Ull er Føroya gull ” states, and after seeing sheep-covered islands and wool-wearing locals across the country, we’d tend to agree. Inspired by the traditional patterns of the Faroese fisherman's jumper , we set about finding ourselves a beautiful woollen jumper to take home as a memento of our times on the Islands. Tórshavn is the epicentre of all wool products, where boutiques sell these famous exports by the dozen, and travellers like us come in search of a bargain. The best, and most popular store is Guðrun & Guðrun , located in downtown Tórshavn, who specialises in sustainable fashion made from locally sourced wool. Their designs are, without question, to die for. Unfortunately, as we discovered, the cost of their garments is somewhat prohibitive (most are in excess of £250), especially on our miserly budget - much to Mim’s chagrin! For those after a cheaper alternative, take a walk around the smaller stores near Tinganes, where prices are somewhat more manageable! THE DETAILS Where | Guðrun & Guðrun EAT AT THE WORLD-FAMOUS KOKS RESTAURANT Including the ridiculously popular but oh-so-incredible KOKS Restaurant on a list of things to do in Torshavn might be a little amiss - the restaurant is located around 20kms outside the city proper. However. You simply can’t visit the Faroe Islands and not enjoy an evening here. Helmed by young head chef/prodigy Poul Andrias Ziska, KOKS Restaurant is the Faroe Islands' first Michelin-starred restaurant. It’s a definite gourmet splurge, but oh guys… it is so worth every cent. Located right in the heart of nature in a picturesque hidden valley, the restaurant perfectly encapsulates what the Faroes are known for; isolation, natural beauty, and unique experiences. The dining experience starts with a bumpy Land Rover ride around a lake’s edge to a quaint Faroese cabin, before the 18-course meal (yes, you read that number right!) with paired wines (paired juice available for non-drinkers) commences. With a focus on locally-sourced and foraged ingredients, the menu is a celebration of traditional Faroese food with a modern twist. Expect delicious seafood and vegetables along with some more uncommon, sometimes controversial, additions like whale blubber (we missed this course), and fermented lamb and fish for the meat-eaters. Vegetarians are well-allocated for, but make sure you let the team know in advance. In a world where unique experiences are becoming harder and harder to find, our meal at KOKs was truly one of the most wonderful, authentic, and unique travel experiences we've had in a long, long time. In fact, keep an eye out for our dedicated KOKS post coming soon! THE DETAILS Where | Frammi við Gjónna, Leynavatn, Faroe Islands Book | Book your place here (note: reservations need to be made months in advance). Tip | Take a cab to the restaurant (about 30min from Tórshavn); alcohol limits for driving in the Faroes are 0. 2024 UPDATE | Unfortunately, KOKS has temporarily relocated to Ilimanaq, Greenland. It will reopen at a new location on the Faroe Islands in the future. Alternatively, visit ROKS , their little cousin. KAYAK THE NORTH ATLANTIC, NORTH OF TÓRSHAVN We’re outdoorsy folk through and through, and while Torshavn isn’t your typical capital city, getting out and exploring the beautiful Streymoy coastline just north of the city was still one of the highlights of our trip. Led by our trusty guide Hans, our half-day kayaking expedition started in Hoyvik, a small village just north of Tórshavn, where we hugged the coastline and made our way south towards Torshavn harbour. We stopped off at various coves, including one with a small waterfall, and various kelp fields before slowly making our way back - stopping only to admire the incredible scenery and nature on what was the best weather day we had in the Faroe Islands. Our guide Hans was a wealth of information, giving us a wonderful overview of the local area and its sometimes turbulent history, and kept us safe among the crazy tidal patterns of the North Atlantic. For those wanting to kayak, NAX offers kayaking tours in various areas of the Faroe Islands including Tórshavn, Bøur, Klaksvik, Kalsoy, Sundalagið and Funningsfjørður. NAX also provides all the necessary equipment, including kayaks, dry bags, and drysuits able to withstand the ice-cold waters of the North Atlantic, which are well below 10c! THE DETAILS Where | Various places on the Faroe Islands, including Tórshavn, Bøur, Klaksvik, Kalsoy, Sundalagið and Funningsfjørður Cost | DKK 400 per person BOOK | This kayaking tour of Hoyvik VISIT THE NATIONAL GALLERY OF THE FAROE ISLANDS There’s no denying the vast majority of your time in the Faroe Islands will be spent exploring the natural attractions of this otherworldly archipelago, and with so much on offer, that’s completely understandable. However, if you’re keen on a slower pace, or perhaps an escape from the weather, we suggest a visit to the National Gallery of the Faroe Islands. Set above the Tórshavn, with views over the surprisingly leafy Viðarlundin í Havn Park, the gallery gives you a profound look into the history of the Faroese people and Faroese art from the 1800s on, including the famous works of Sámal Joensen-Mikines. Although the museum is not large, it does an excellent job of tying the Islands' history to multimedia, works of sculpture, painting and engaging exhibits. We spent 2 hours but felt we needed more time to see everything. Oh, and the on-site café does a lovely cappuccino and cinnamon roll. THE DETAILS Where | The National Gallery of the Faroe Islands Entry Fee | Adult ticket: 90 DKK/$~13 USD per person, with seniors and students concessions TAKE A DAY TRIP TO QUIRKY NOLSOY Located off the coast of Tórshavn is Nólsoy, a delightfully quirky, artsy, and liberal island. Our visit coincided with some famously thick Faroese fog, so our plans to hike to the island’s lighthouse and enjoy the natural beauty were largely thwarted. Instead, we spent the majority of the day curled up inside the cosy wooden cabin of the Nólsoy Visitor's Centre , enjoying their delicious homemade food (the steamed cod and potatoes are amazing, and you simply must try the homemade waffles with rhubarb jam and cream), and relishing in being toasty warm while the fog danced over the sea outside. The centre also has a sauna which visitors are welcome to use. Although there's not a huge amount to see and do in a town of 250 inhabitants, a visit to the church is worthwhile and there are a number of photogenic homes and boat sheds. The Nólsoy community is quite bohemian and extremely creatively minded, and there are many artworks dotted throughout the village. The port, in particular, had several beautiful murals and is outrageously photogenic. Alternatively, for those visiting on a clearer day than us, the hike to the Nólsoy lighthouse is highly recommended (14 km or 5 hours, starting in Nólsoy). For us, the beauty of our day on Nólsoy was meeting the liberally-minded locals, and enjoying the chilled lifestyle which makes this island a haven for Torshavn locals on weekends and holidays. The ferry to Nólsoy takes around 20 mins and leaves from Tórshavn harbour up to six times a day. THE DETAILS Where | Nólsoy How to get to Nolsoy | Catch the 90 ferry from Tórshavn harbour. Depending on the day, the ferry runs up to 6 times. Check out the departure times here . Cost | Ferries start at DKK15 per person ENJOY ÓLAVSØKA, THE FAROESE NATIONAL DAY IN JULY If possible, we recommend planning your visit to the Faroe Islands to coincide with Ólavsøka , the national day of the Faroe Islands. A true Faroese cultural experience, Ólavsøka has origins in Norway and began as a memorial feast for the Norwegian King Olav the Holy, who was killed in the battle of Stiklestad, in Norway, on 29 July 1030. It's believed his death contributed to the subsequent Christianisation of Norway and the Faroe Islands. Each year, locals from all corners of the Faroe Islands archipelago and beyond descend on Tórshavn dressed in their traditional Faroese costumes, ready for a weekend of fun and frivolity. The main festivities include cultural, musical, and sporting activities, like the hotly contested national rowing race. For the millennials, there’s many a party to be had. We spent the weekend joining in the festivities, walking the streets of Tórshavn, eating local food, listening to traditional folk music, and enjoying a beer or two in the main square. We even briefly got to meet the Prime Minister as he scurried past after a group photo! It was wonderful to see the local traditions alive and well and that everyone old and young was in the festive spirit. The celebrations conclude at midnight on Sunday, when crowds gather in the town square to sing traditional Faroese ballads and take part in the traditional Faroese chain dance (otherwise known as Midnight Song). It really is an incredible sight (watch this video for an idea ). THE DETAILS What | Ólavsøka, Tórshavn When | Each year in July Tip | Accommodation for the festival books up months in advance, so if you're planning to visit at this time, keep this in mind! WHERE TO EAT AND DRINK IN TÓRSHAVN SIRKUS FÖROYAR Even in somewhere as remote as the Faroe Islands, hipster hangouts exist and thrive. And Sirkus is that place in Torshavn. Set above a craft beer bar (which you should also spend time in), the atmosphere at Sirkus is unbeatable; the walls are adorned with art, there's a free-for-all piano, and there’s just a friendly, welcoming vibe amongst the patrons. The food is pretty standard, we enjoyed an Indian vegetarian curry, washed down with an Icelandic beer, and the prices are affordable for the Faroes. All in all, if you’re looking for somewhere unpretentious to chill and eat, Sirkus is your place. SKEIVA PAKKHÚS A fairly new addition to the Torshavn dining scene, Skeiva Pakkhús serves super modern Italian-inspired dishes made with the freshest local Faroese produce. It’s the best of both worlds, served up in a too-cool tapas-like format. The location on Vestaravág harbour is stunning, as is the Scandi-inspired interior. ROKS Set within a historic, turf-roofed cabin in the centre of Tórshavn is the laidback, cosmopolitan sister of KOKS, ROKS. As with KOKS, ROKS serves up incredible dishes with produce directly from the bountiful Faroese landscapes & waters, and this focus on local produce elevates dishes beyond exceptional. There are two set menu options - ‘nearly ashore’ which is a smaller tasting menu of the best plates, and ‘totally on the roks’, which serves up a nine-course tapas-style dining experience. Similar again to KOKS, each menu is paired with incredible wines that match the dishes perfectly. While the plates are small and the menu expensive, the unique flavours, excellent presentation and overall experience make ROKS worth the visit. ETIKA Sushi lovers unite - Etika is the place to get your seafood fix in Tórshavn. They serve super fresh and well-prepared sushi daily (straight from the North Atlantic!), and it’s possible to both eat in or take away. Other locally recommended restaurants in Torshavn include: Áarstova Barbara Fish House Ræst Kaffihúsið Hvonn Café Umami A MAP OF THE BEST THINGS TO DO IN TÓRSHAVN We’ve created a detailed map of the best places to visit in Tórshavn, as well as where to eat, which you can download for your visit.

Tórshavn is the capital and largest city of the Faroe Islands and is located in the southern part of the island of Streymoy, the largest island in the Faroes. The city is the cultural and administrative centre of the Faroe Islands, an is home to around 22,000 residents, almost half of the population of the Faroe Islands. It’s the perfect base for all your Island adventures, so we suggest booking a hotel in town (see above), and exploring the nearby attractions and islands. WHEN IS THE BEST TIME TO VISIT TÓRSHAVN? We'd recommend visiting the Faroe Islands in Summer, between July and August, when the weather is slightly more stable and the days long, allowing for more exploration, perfect for any packed Faroe Islands itinerary. For Torshavn specifically, try to plan your visit during Ólavsøka, the Faroese national day in late July. For those more intrepid travellers, the winter can provide incredible scenery, but with two to four hours of sunlight a day, we just don't think it's worth it. HOW TO GET TO AND AROUND TÓRSHAVN While the Faroe Islands are remote, getting to them really isn't as difficult as you might think at first glance of your Google Maps. Here are some of the ways you can get to the Tórshavn yourself: BY AIR These days, the Faroes national carrier, Atlantic Airways , flies from London (just announced!), Edinburgh (this is how we got there!), Copenhagen (Denmark), Bergen (Norway), Reykjavik (Iceland) to Vagar airport year-round, with a flight time between 1-2 hours for each. Scandinavian Airlines (SAS) also flies a route from Copenhagen. Prices are also pretty reasonable for the adventure of a lifetime; between £100-150 return from Edinburgh with Atlantic! It’s important to note that you don’t fly directly to Tórshavn, but rather Vagar airport which is located on the island of Vagar. Taxis and local buses service the Vagar - Tórshavn route and can be arranged on arrival. BY FERRY If you have the time, the taste for adventure, and the love for slow travel, you can also take a ferry to the Faroe Islands. The Smyril Line operates services between Denmark (Hirtshals), the Faroes, and Iceland twice a week in summer, and once during winter. Each trip takes about 37 hours and you can take your car on board too! Getting around Torshavn is super easy, with the best things to do in Torshavn located within walking distance of the city centre. Alternatively, take one of the local Tórshavn buses which are free to everyone. PARKING IN TÓRSHAVN If you’re planning to road trip through the Faroes (which we totally recommend), parking in the capital city of Tórshavn can be a real pain. Parking spaces are difficult to come by in the town itself, often they're res", "images": ["https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5a3bb03b4c326d76de73ddaa/f20b2fbd-9e62-4646-8478-7b1c0a0b8d96/The_Common_Wanderer_-7702.jpg", "https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5a3bb03b4c326d76de73ddaa/ed02c132-6eba-4219-b4c1-c3ec010b0ecc/The_Common_Wanderer_-9903.jpg", "https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5a3bb03b4c326d76de73ddaa/c957277d-9aa6-4f6c-9671-2de016d97337/The_Common_Wanderer_-8338.jpg", "https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5a3bb03b4c326d76de73ddaa/1723083158406-8JE8GU3S216IR8XDSOBZ/The_Common_Wanderer_-9783.jpg", "https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5a3bb03b4c326d76de73ddaa/1723083158176-SU8E5FOA25IGN8M9B2HP/The_Common_Wanderer_-9782.jpg", "https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5a3bb03b4c326d76de73ddaa/1723083230354-7USC0FR7DK35U687A1UR/The_Common_Wanderer_-9638.jpg", "https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5a3bb03b4c326d76de73ddaa/1723083230616-R3LO291H55SEAMCF1144/The_Common_Wanderer_-7735.jpg", "https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5a3bb03b4c326d76de73ddaa/1723083267878-HL226KC5UHTXRY4NNHI6/The_Common_Wanderer_-8002.jpg", "https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5a3bb03b4c326d76de73ddaa/1723083268071-GV5CTFQG5OPMDDZ04QPS/The_Common_Wanderer_-7989.jpg", "https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5a3bb03b4c326d76de73ddaa/623d8a97-32a2-4419-83e6-f23f703c129d/The_Common_Wanderer_-0052358.jpg", "https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5a3bb03b4c326d76de73ddaa/1586841048484-9AVXDM45Q7A4OGL1CV1G/The+Common+Wanderer_-27.jpg", "https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5a3bb03b4c326d76de73ddaa/1723083841952-EKLLLDY5MNSTHFWPGHFR/The_Common_Wanderer_-7895.jpg", "https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5a3bb03b4c326d76de73ddaa/1723083844152-AKIWF9POE154O8WJIT9T/The_Common_Wanderer_-7920.jpg", "https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5a3bb03b4c326d76de73ddaa/1723083943606-J7Y0UKH0KWUB5GPZWRRJ/The_Common_Wanderer_-8329.jpg", "https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5a3bb03b4c326d76de73ddaa/1723083943175-7T9SMW79QLQM852A84AR/The_Common_Wanderer_-0114.jpg", "https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5a3bb03b4c326d76de73ddaa/1723083982633-9YW7TLUWFWU20Q737KDA/The_Common_Wanderer_-7716.jpg", "https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5a3bb03b4c326d76de73ddaa/1723083982871-TEZM2GST9P2CPG5JMH1L/The_Common_Wanderer_-7729.jpg", "https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5a3bb03b4c326d76de73ddaa/1723083984240-UGAEHZJ8QEFUSPPWE6GT/The_Common_Wanderer_-7723.jpg", "https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5a3bb03b4c326d76de73ddaa/1723083986594-OBWIC60RSAWL9EUZY47L/The_Common_Wanderer_-7710.jpg", "https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5a3bb03b4c326d76de73ddaa/1622205763618-ZBBEQ56OAPBTRUK4L25T/Screen+Shot+2021-05-28+at+2.33.31+pm.png", "https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5a3bb03b4c326d76de73ddaa/956f0b26-32f4-433f-b119-ab75689ae94f/The_Common_Wanderer_-8399.jpg", "https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5a3bb03b4c326d76de73ddaa/1723164440378-HGEG4SC5MI98V47OVPUA/The_Common_Wanderer_-7474.jpg", "https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5a3bb03b4c326d76de73ddaa/1723171941029-7ERZEFR6VEHM0ANUDPP4/The_Common_Wanderer_-8357-2.jpg", "https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5a3bb03b4c326d76de73ddaa/1723169162878-FT0XTZGOIM28AA0KQP4Z/The_Common_Wanderer_-7799-2.jpg", "https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5a3bb03b4c326d76de73ddaa/1621939986277-N4073SCJOLWZ7LUNQAWR/The+Common+Wanderer-7702-2.jpg", "https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5a3bb03b4c326d76de73ddaa/1621939622179-CUYBIBC0MQNMGOIGXIC7/The+Common+Wanderer-8940.jpg", "https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5a3bb03b4c326d76de73ddaa/1621940274548-57K4U7LRBW688G2UEBXS/The+Common+Wanderer-7345.jpg", "https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5a3bb03b4c326d76de73ddaa/1678155704461-UCQOJCPZVYCVB2ANCHFE/The+Common+Wanderer-8885.jpg", "https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5a3bb03b4c326d76de73ddaa/1597928028001-H16946VPR5I075M7W4QK/The+Common+Wanderer_FAROES-9.jpg", "https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v2/namespaces/memberAccountAvatars/libraries/59b1acb3f5e231475663379e/c7ace3d6aaf04874890a308cf8605f3b/c7ace3d6aaf04874890a308cf8605f3b.jpeg?format=300w"]}

We’ve heard it said that you either love or hate Ho Chi Minh City. Either you get swept up by its always-frenetic pace, the sticky heat beating down through the tangle of buildings and knotted electrical wires, the bewildering traffic, the clang and sizzle of its many street food carts, its flickering neon lights and energy. Or you arrive and immediately beeline for the nearest exit and a calmer pace. You’ll find us firmly in the first camp. Vietnam’s southern city is, admittedly, transforming into an urban metropolis. Gleaming skyscrapers, fast-paced commerce and flashy establishments are propelling the country forward at dizzying speeds. But beneath that constant hum of modernity, glimpses of daily life can always be found. In the mornings before the thick blanket of humidity settles over the city and the streets become choked with traffic fumes and chaos, there’s just hazy golden light, a quiet stillness, and the very first hints of brewing caffeinated rocket fuel tickling in your nose. Early worms stack crisp baguettes in metal carts ready for the day’s Bánh mi orders, meditatively sweep the streets clean of yesterday’s debris, or stare contemplatively from plastic stools over bowls of steaming savoury broth. In the evenings, Saigon’s side streets and squares cheerfully erupt into life; Kids play badminton with their parents as tightly-wrapped parcels of food are collected from favourite carts, friends and strangers sit shoulder-to-shoulder on plastic stools spilling onto the street, the steam from their bowls illuminated by flickering neon light. Karaoke playlists are loaded, and fresh, crisp Bia Hoi is poured from tap to glass. In contrast to the heat and honking bedlam of the day, it’s these daily bookend hours that were not just our favourite to wander through the city in, but also what we feel makes the city deserving of your time and explorations. Here, you’ll find the best things to do in Ho Chi Minh City , including our recommendations on where to stay, the best things to do, where to source the best Vietnamese coffee, and our absolute favourite spots for filling a hungry tummy.

Newly built apartments in District One with of everything we needed for a comfortable stay (especially with a toddler) THINGS TO DO IN HO CHI MINH CITY (SAIGON) LEARN ABOUT THE VIETNAM WAR AT THE WAR REMNANTS MUSEUM An essential stop for any visitor seeking to better understand Vietnam’s difficult past, the War Remnants Museum offers an unflinching and meticulous insight into the harsh realities of the entire Vietnam War. Once called the Museum of American Atrocities - before the relationship between the two countries improved - and housed over 3 floors of a fairly nondescript building in Ho Chi Minh’s centre, the collection makes for queasy viewing: reproductions of ‘tiger cages’ used to torture and hold political prisoners, a guillotine used in executions of those prisoners, gruesome and graphic photographs of the My Lai massacre and the impacts of toxic chemical agents like Napalm (the effects which still linger in communities today), glimpses of the global protest movement against the war, and collections of bullet-ridden planes and tanks in the grounds. It’s worth noting that over the years, the museum has attracted criticism for its ‘propaganda’ and for portraying a one-sided view of the conflict — although we do wonder if perhaps that’s because it’s quite rare for the victims of US military action to have the space and accessibility to express the impacts of conflict in such a way. Either way, the museum is a devastating look at the immense human cost to both Vietnamese civilians and soldiers and American soldiers, and we found it to be an incredibly sombre and confronting experience, so definitely add it to your list of things to do in Ho Chi Minh City. THE DETAILS Where | Phường 6, District 3 , HCMC Entrance Fee | 40,000 VND per person Opening Hours | 7:30 am - 5:30 pm BOOK | Skip-the-line access with this highly-rated War Remnants Museum & Independence Palace tour SEE SAIGON FROM ABOVE AT THE SAIGON SKYDECK Is it a tourist trap? Yes. Is it expensive? Yes. Should you do it? YES. We always appreciate seeing a city from above, hovering above the chaos at street level and getting to observe all the life that exists on its streets from a totally new vantage point. The unique lotus-shaped Bitexco tower is visible from almost every corner of the city — and its Saigon Skydeck is the perfect place for some birds-eye viewing. Offering 360-degree views over HCMC, you really could spend an age up there discovering every nook and cranny of Saigon, pointing out its various landmarks, its mix of colonial and modern architecture, and the pace of new construction visible from each new window. Given Saigon’s pollution, don’t expect the clearest of views from the top - but on the day we visited, we actually found the gold and pink haze provided a kind of ethereal glow; towers in the distance seemed to emerge like ghost ship silhouettes and it gave an unexpectedly dreamy quality to this dynamic metropolis Bonus, it’s air-conditioned, which provides a very welcome relief from the steaming afternoon air - and from the sun beating through the floor-to-ceiling windows of the observatory itself. The tower was also, surprisingly, very free of tourist crowds when we visited in the late afternoon. Tickets are available to purchase until 45 minutes before closing, and can also be booked online ahead of time (purchase them on Klook here or GetYourGuide here ). THE DETAILS Where | Bitexco Tower Saigon Skydeck, District 1, HCMC Entrance Fee | 240,000 VND per adult, 160,000 VND for seniors & minors (2024).

Also doesn’t provide access to the Lotus-shaped outcrop EXPLORE HO CHI MINH’S OTHER EXCELLENT MUSEUMS HO CHI MINH CITY MUSEUM Housed in a stunning French colonial-era building (which in itself is a must-see), the Ho Chi Minh City Museum ( link ) is the custodian of the city’s often tumultuous, always fascinating past. A range of exhibits walk you through Vietnam’s varied history, from prehistoric times and the story of settlement in the region, through the struggle for independence against French colonialism. It provides an in-depth look at the Vietnam War and its aftermath and the country’s ongoing development as a growing SE Asian economic powerhouse. All exhibits feature a decent collection of artefacts, photographs, and documents that paint a detailed picture of the city’s evolution over time. A personal highlight was its exhibition on the struggle for independence from French rule - it’s always super interesting to see history from the lens of the oppressed. Additional exhibits showcase traditional Vietnamese costumes, folk art, and artefacts from various ethnic groups, as well as an impressive collection of antique ceramics, furniture, and coins. We’re not going to lie, the museum itself isn’t the greatest you’ll ever set foot in - but if you’re in Saigon for three or more days, it’s definitely worth a visit, if not simply for the building itself. THE DETAILS Where | 65 Lý Tự Trọng, Bến Nghé , District 1, HCMC Entrance Fee | 40,000 VND, cash only Opening Hours | 8 am - 5 pm every day HO CHI MINH CITY MUSEUM OF FINE ARTS The Ho Chi Minh City Museum of Fine Arts is another of the city’s museums housed in a beautiful French colonial-era building and is worth a stop if you’re interested in art, or keen to understand Vietnam’s rich cultural scene. The museum's collection ranges from ancient sculptures and traditional handicrafts to modern paintings and installations, blocked into pre and post-1975. Each floor of this magnificent building is dedicated to showcasing different eras and styles of Vietnamese art. The ground floor often hosts temporary exhibitions, spotlighting emerging artists and contemporary themes, while the upper floors showcase the museum's permanent collection, which includes works by some of Vietnam's most celebrated artists. It does contain a lot of political and war rhetoric, but amongst that, there are some absolute gems that are worth your time (and even a position in the Louvre). One thing to note, though, is that the building is not air-conditioned - it can be a hot stroll through the complex, so bring plenty of water! THE DETAILS Where | 97A P. Đức Chính, Phường Nguyễn Thái Bình , District 1, HCMC Entrance Fee | 40,000 VND, Cash only Opening Hours | 8am - 5pm every day STEP INSIDE THE JADE EMPEROR PAGODA An unexpected highlight of our trip to Ho Chi Minh City was the visit we made to the red-hued Jade Emperor Pagoda on the outskirts of District One. Built in 1909 by the Chinese community who reside in Saigon, the pagoda is dedicated to the Taoist Jade Emperor and is definitely one of the most atmospheric places to visit in this bustling city. A heady mix of incense, flower offerings and the subtle scent of aged wood hangs heavy in the air, the scent of which actually transported us to another of our favourite countries, Nepal, and the temples of Kathmandu. Take your time to marvel at the architecture, adorned with elaborate sculptures of dragons and phoenixes, vibrant tile mosaics, and intricate carvings depicting scenes from both Buddhist and Taoist legends. You can also walk through the surrounding figures of worship, including the God of Hell, Goddess of Mercy, and the God of Wealth - which are frequented by faithful who come to offer incense, prayers, and hopes for the future — though do note that photography isn’t allowed in this section. Beyond its obvious beauty and religious significance, we found it an interesting insight into the lives and beliefs of the Chinese community in Vietnam. Entrance to the Jade Emperor Pagoda is free, however, you can request a tour guide, who will explain the importance and architectural details of the pagoda. THE DETAILS Where | Jade Emperor Pagoda, 73 Ð Mai Thi Luu Entrance Fee | Free, although donations are appreciated Opening Hours | 7 am - 6 pm SPEND A DAY AT CU CHI TUNNELS While the Americans may have had the mightier weapon power during the Vietnam War, the Cu Chi Tunnels are proof that the Vietnamese had incredible ingenuity and strategy on their side — two factors key to their successful resistance. About a 1.5-hour drive (in good traffic!) from Ho Chi Minh City, the Cu Chi tunnels were used by the guerilla-style VietCong to go, quite literally, underground to hide from their enemy and plan offensive attacks (learn more about the tunnel’s history here ). Today, the tunnels have been preserved - and widened slightly to accommodate Westerners - and the complex has now transformed into a museum of this unique style of warfare, becoming one of Vietnam’s most visited tourist sites in the process. We took a private tour of the tunnels (book the one we did here), and while it was an interesting visit, we have to admit we have mixed feelings about it. Like similar sites around the world, the experience felt a little over-commercialised and soulless; many of the exhibits felt gimmicky and the photo ops a little tacky. Any visit here is also punctuated by the sound of trigger-happy tourists firing war guns at the range, a totally unnecessary detour every visitor is funnelled through and forced to spend a good few minutes within an ear-shattering range of shots being fired without any protection. We’d probably recommend Ben Duoc over Ben Dinh (where we went) as they are meant to be more authentic examples of the tunnels in their original state and less crowded with tourists than the main site. For those travelling here with kids: it does get hot during the day, so come prepared. We found the site is entirely pram-friendly too — and seriously, bring some kind of headphones with you if you can to protect sensitive little ears at the firing range! THE DETAILS Where | Phú Hiệp, Củ Chi , HCMC Entrance Fees | 125,000 VND per person Opening Hours | Daily, 7 am–5 pm BOOK | Book a Cu Chi Tunnels Day Tour (this is the private day tour we did, or an affordable group trip ), or a Ben Duoc Tunnels tour SAMPLE LOCAL LIFE IN HO CHI MINH’S MARKETS Saigon’s markets are where culture, cuisine and commerce collide; a microcosm of the city itself and vital to the day-to-day life of its residents. They’re vibrant, chaotic, and utterly captivating - and for us, the perfect places to understand this bustling city and its people. The heart of the city is the historic Ben Thanh Market . With its art deco facade and iconic clock tower presiding over the hustle and bustle of central Ho Chi Minh City, it’s one of the most recognisable icons of the city. While you can find just about anything here, from fresh produce and seafood to handicrafts, textiles, and home decor, it’s become somewhat of a tourist trap over the years, selling same-same souvenirs and nicknacks for tourists. This lack of authenticity takes the shine off a visit, however, it does still make for a wonderful starting point for first-time visitors. In the evening, the market transforms into a street food haven, perfect to sample your first Vietnamese street food. Beyond Ben Thanh, there are markets in every district, and seemingly on every street corner. In the heart of Chinatown is Binh Tay Market (District 5), another art deco delight but far more local in vibe. Don’t expect tourist-centric goods, it’s mostly wholesale here, but from a purely visual perspective, the colours and details are thoroughly enjoyable to witness. There’s also a food hall that serves up Vietnamese delights. Possibly our favourite market though, is Bàn Cờ , located deep in the laneways of District 3. The wet market is filled with the usual sights and sounds - fresh meat and seafood, vegetables, textiles, and gossiping Aunties. You’ll also see things you weren’t prepared for - ox tongues, brains, intestines, snakes, and snails by the bucketload. It’s narrow, sweaty, and colourful, and is the most authentic place we visited in the city. There are also a number of very good street food vendors within the markets- we ate amazingly well here, trying sủi cao tôm thịt (dumpling soup) and a dessert of Chè Changhi (coconut milk-based pudding) which we still dream about. BOOK | This wonderful Saigon markets & food tour EAT TILL YOU CAN’T EAT NO MORE & JOIN A SAIGON FOODIE TOUR The heart of Ho Chi Minh City's culinary scene beats strongest on its streets, where food vendors and open-air markets dish out local favourites - not surprising in a city of 10 million people, where almost 1 million make a living by selling food on the street. Street food is a vital part of Saigon, and it’s on the streets where you’ll find the best and most authentic food. But that being said, don’t sleep on the restaurant scene which is transforming Saigon’s gastronomic offering by blending traditional ingredients with global culinary techniques. To help us navigate the vast foodie scene in town, we joined a street food tour which opened our eyes (and taste buds) to a world of Vietnamese cuisine we knew nothing about. We visited nondescript Michelin-recommend holes in the wall, and street sellers, and devoured some of the best Banh Mi ever while delving deeper into the local markets and discovering local delicacies. The tour then allowed us to enjoy the rest of our time in Vietnam much more, as we knew what and where to find the best food. We highly recommend joining a food tour (book ours here ) - it was potentially the best thing we did in Ho Chi Minh City, but if you’re keen on your own explorations amongst the city’s myriad of markets and vendors, below is what you need to try, and where. STREET FOOD & DISHES TO TRY IN SAIGON TÀU HỦ NÓNG | Often found on street corners, Tàu Hủ Nóng is a silken tofu pudding with ginger syrup, coconut milk, pandan leaves and tapioca pearls. Sweet, spicy, and savoury, all at the same time PHO | Pho is the quintessential Vietnamese noodle soup, and a breakfast (and for most tourists, lunch and dinner) staple. A delicious broth traditionally made from beef bones and a blend of spices. Served with rice noodles, tender slices of beef (or tofu), and fresh herbs, it’s the perfect dish. BÚN THỊT NƯỚNG | One of the best dishes in Vietnam, hands down, Bún thịt nướng pairs grilled marinated pork with vermicelli noodles, fresh herbs, and salad. Topped with peanuts and fried shallots, it's served with tangy nước chấm sauce. Washed down with an iced-jasmine tea, is the best way to start the day BÁNH CUỐN NHÂN THỊT | A personal morning favourite of ours is Bánh cuốn nhân thịt, which consists of thin, steamed rice flour rolls filled with seasoned ground pork. The dish typically includes rice flour, ground pork, bean sprouts, wood ear mushrooms, shallots, various herbs and fish sauce for dipping. BÁNH MÌ | Don't miss out on bánh mì, a Vietnamese sandwich that's a symphony of flavours packed into a crispy baguette BÒ LÁ LỐT | Bò lá lốt is a dish of seasoned ground beef wrapped in lá lốt leaves (betel leafs), which are then grilled to perfection. The leaves leave a peppery and slightly bitter flavour that complements the savoury, spiced beef. Often served with rice noodles and fresh herbs BÁNH XÈO | A sizzling savoury pancake filled with shrimp, pork, and bean sprouts, wrapped in lettuce, and dunked in tangy fish sauce CƠM TẤM/CƠM GA | Cơm tấm, or \"broken rice,\" is typically served with grilled pork or chicken. Accompanied by a fried egg, fresh vegetables, and pickled sides, it's completed with nước chấm sauce.

It’s been nearly three months since our travels took us to Vietnam, and one thing has remained clear every time we’ve sat down to put our time in Hanoi into words: No words we write here will ever fully prepare you for the assault on your senses that is Vietnam’s northern capital. A dizzying whirlwind of honking traffic, crumbling colonial architecture, and deliciously fragrant flavours that give way to potent motorbike fumes all in the same breath; it’s a city that truly exists in the well-used traveller cliches of contrasts and juxtapositions. It’s rapidly modernising but holds thousands of years of history within its streets. Overwhelmingly claustrophobic, especially in the tangled streets of the Old Quarter , it also hides pockets of tranquillity at places like Hoan Kiem Lake and the Temple of Literature. The same broad streets that house strikingly beautiful belle époque facades and ancient temples are also often hazardous; choked by traffic fumes and charcoal smoke, tangled wires and a constant thrum of people. As a traveller, you very quickly have to make a decision on whether you get swept along by its frenetic pace and allow the chaos to captivate and excite, or rally against it and find yourself spat back onto its ochre-hued streets. We found ourselves oscillating between the two for most of our time there. One minute we’d be perched street-side over a mouthwatering tapioca-broth noodle soup and declare we were firmly in love; the next we’d be overwhelmed on its chaotic streets and looking for a quick exit to the nearest coffee shop. Whether you end up falling in love with its streets or not, one thing is for certain: you’ll never forget the sensory experience of your first trip to Hanoi. As the gateway to adventures in Ha Long Bay and Ninh Binh, it’s also fairly unavoidable that you’ll spend some time here on your Vietnam travels, so we’ve put this guide together on the best things to do in Hanoi, plus tips on how to beat the overwhelm, where to stay and eat, and how to get around the city.

While we did have a lovely, quiet, immersive stay in a very local area it did mean we spent a lot of time sitting in Grabs in heavy traffic just to do simple sightseeing… which isn’t always the best fun to do with said toddler, or if you’re really looking to get the most of your time in a destination. For that reason, we’ve included three recommendations for where to stay in the Old Quarter THE CAPELLA HANOI | Combining French colonial and Art Deco styles, the Capella Hanoi is definitely one of the best hotels in Hanoi. In addition to the opulent rooms that exude colonial charm, there’s exquisite dining, a chic spa, and a central location near the Old Quarter LA SIESTA PREMIUM HANG BE | Located in the heart of the Old Quarter, La Siesta Premium Hang Be has lovely, modern rooms, a rooftop bar with city views (definitely enjoy a sunset cocktail up here), and excellent customer service OLD QUARTER VIEW HANOI HOSTEL | Located in the heart of the Old Quarter, the affordable and highly-rated Old Quarter View Hanoi Hostel offers basic amenities, free Wi-Fi, and complimentary breakfast, making it a great choice for those on a budget THE BEST THINGS TO DO IN HANOI EXPLORE HANOI’S BUSTLING OLD QUARTER ‘Overwhelming’ is the feeling we’d use to describe Hanoi’s Old Quarter , Hoan Kiem. The historic heart of the city and the centre point of thousands of years of Vietnamese history is chaotic. The streets hum with life; every nook and cranny is filled with street vendors selling just about anything - fruits, cooking utensils, textiles, silver. The footpaths are crammed with street stalls and parked motorbikes, and invariably you’ll find yourself walking on the narrow roads, dodging honking scooters, cyclos and people. The weathered colonial buildings, towering trees, and constant noise also make it feel a little claustrophobic at times. But that cacophonic overwhelm is also part of what makes exploring Hanoi’s Old Quarter an exciting place to explore. The origins of this quarter can be traced back to the 11th century when King Ly Thai To moved the capital to this area, transforming it into a bustling centre of trade. Its streets were organically mapped by the guilds that settled there, and each street (Hang) was named for the specific trade that dominated its path - a tradition you’ll see reflected in street signs today. There’s Hang Bong, which sells cotton; Hang Bac, selling silver; Hang Duong, selling sugar; and Hang Non, selling hats. As the city evolved over time, so too did Hoan Kiem’s architecture, reflecting the city’s rich and eclectic past as a powerful trading city. Buildings and pagodas dating to ancient Chinese dynasties are scattered amongst crumbling traditional Hanoi ‘tubular’ buildings and faded French colonial architecture. To slowly wander the district’s streets today is to immerse yourself in the centuries of history reflected all around you - as well as a guaranteed way to fall in love with Hanoi. Where to start? Choose a street, any street, and start walking. The Old Quarter loosely starts at Hoan Kiem Lake and encompasses the streets and alleyways towards Long Bien. Float through and follow your nose. Stop by a street food vendor for a snack, head deep into the markets and witness the clamour of commerce, spot ancient pagodas and architectural delights, and end the day on a blue stool sipping Bia Hoi by the dozen. Alternatively, join a city walking tour and let a guide take you on the journey. THE DETAILS Where | Hanoi Old Quarter Stop | A few recommended stops include Ta Hien Corner (pub street) , Dong Xuan Market, Ô Quan Chưởng city gate, and Ly Trieu Quoc Su Pagoda READ | Our curated guide to Hanoi’s Old Quarter BOOK | This highly-rated Hanoi city walking tour EXPLORE THE HO CHI MINH PRECINCT You only need to spend a brief moment in Vietnam to realise that Ho Chi Minh is as revered today as he was 60 years ago. A revolutionary leader and founding father of modern Vietnam, Uncle Ho is celebrated for his tireless commitment to Vietnam's liberation from colonial rule. Under his leadership, Vietnam defeated the French at Dien Bien Phu in 1954, a historic turning point that led to the division of Vietnam and set the stage for the Vietnam War. Ho Chi Minh's vision extended beyond the battlefield; he aspired to create a socialist republic and pushed for social reforms to eliminate poverty and promote education. While his legacy might be complex, especially from a Western gaze, he is immortalised in the hearts of the Vietnamese people, not only through the renaming of Saigon to Ho Chi Minh City but also through the various historical reference points in Hanoi, in which he spent time and now rests. Within the Ho Chi Minh precinct, there are a few major attractions that we suggest visiting (see below). Although you can book a guided tour (here), we actually think it’s best to explore the surroundings at your own pace - unless, of course, you’re interested in Vietnamese history. HO CHI MINH MAUSOLEUM Inaugurated in 1975, the brutalist Ho Chi Minh mausoleum stands as a celebration of Uncle Ho’s life and achievements. Inside, in a glass case houses the preserved body of Ho Chi Minh, which has become a site of pilgrimage for millions of Vietnamese and international visitors each year, who queue up for the chance to pay their respects to \"Uncle Ho\" in a quiet, controlled procession. The experience itself is quick - you’re not allowed to stop, but slowly encircle the glass casket before moving on. If you’re not keen to enter, you can admire the mausoleum from the large square adjoining the area. Entry is free, save for a quick security checkpoint, but you’ll need to cover up. PRESIDENTIAL PALACE The striking, bright yellow facade and green shutters of the adjacent Presidential Palace juxtapose strikingly with Ho Chi Minh’s stark Mausoleum. The former residence for the French Governor-General of Indochina, the stunning palace and surrounding grounds were offered to Ho Chi Minh upon independence in 1945. He refused on principle, instead opting for a more modest dwelling in the palace grounds, known as the Stilt House (see below). Constructed between 1900 and 1906, and set against a backdrop of lush gardens, the Presidential Palace is worth a look, although only from the outside - the building is still a working Government building, so the interior remains off-limits. HO CHI MINH’S STILT HOUSE Ho Chi Minh’s humble stilt house is actually the stuff of architectural dreams; a simple light-filled two-story tropical oasis filled with antique furniture and minimal distractions, built on stilts and surrounded by beautiful gardens. The house has been preserved just as Ho left it in 1969. Although visitors are unable to enter, you can walk around the exterior and peer in through the open windows and doorways, and admire the simple, stately setting. Continue along the garden path and admire the gardens, before exiting to the nearby One Pillar Pagoda. HO CHI MINH MUSEUM Located near the iconic Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum and the Presidential Palace, the Ho Chi Minh Museum is a monumental tribute to the life and legacy of the respected leader. Designed in a modernist style to represent a lotus flower, the building itself is a must-see in Hanoi. Inside, the museum is divided into eight chronological sections, from birth through to his crowning years as leader of the new Vietnam, and finally through to his death in 1969. As you’d expect, each section has been curated to reflect different aspects of Ho Chi Minh's life and the global influences that shaped his philosophical and political ideologies and features memorabilia, such as photographs, letters, and even personal belongings, to frame his life. We appreciated the museum’s somewhat nuanced representation of the complex and controversial aspects of Uncle Ho’s life - seeing Communism celebrated, especially as a Westerner can sometimes be jarring, but overall we didn’t feel it was a propaganda tool, but rather a balanced museum. So is this museum for everyone? Probably not, but we’d definitely include it as part of a half-day exploring the Ho Chi Minh complex. THE DETAILS Where | Ho Chi Minh Precinct, Ba Dinh Square Opening Hours | Every day except Monday afternoon, 7:30 am - 11 am, 1:30 pm - 4 pm in the Summer, 8 am - 11 am, 1:30 pm - 4 pm in the Winter Cost | Combined entrance ticket into the Presidential Palace complex, including the grounds and Ho Chi Minh’s Stilt House which is 40,000 VND, payable at the gate Note | Ho Chi Minh’s Mausoleum is closed on Mondays and Fridays, and for at least 2 months (June 15-August 15) for annual maintenance but you can still take pictures of the Mausoleum and walk around the area EAT LIKE BOURDAIN IN HANOI If idolising Anthony Bourdain when it comes to travel and foodie experiences makes us walking cliches, well, so be it. Because we do, and his love affair with Vietnam and Vietnamese food is one of (the very many) reasons we chose to visit the country: to embrace and understand the complexity of its cuisine. To quote the man himself - \"Vietnamese cuisine is a master class in the art of balance and subtlety. It's not just about bombarding the senses; it's about engaging them with a kind of elegance and refinement”. We couldn’t put it better if we tried (and we did, trust us, but no one has a way with words quite like Bourdain did). The food we sampled in Hanoi, so different from the lighter, fresh offerings found in the south, was astoundingly good. We’ll both never, ever forget the first taste of morning Pho from a nondescript Old Quarter cafe, the smokiness of the warming tapioca broth, the richness of the beef, and the subtle balance of herbs. As such, one of the best things to do in Hanoi is eat. And eat. And eat. And the best way to do that is by joining a Hanoi street food tour. Similar to our tour in Ho Chi Minh City , this street food tour stopped by hidden storefronts, holes in the wall, street sellers, and some of the best Banh Mi ever, while delving deeper into the local markets and discovering local delicacies. The tour allowed us to enjoy the rest of our time in Hanoi and Vietnam much more, as we knew what and where to find the best food. We highly recommend joining a food tour - it was potentially the best thing we did in Hanoi. But if you’re keen on your own explorations amongst the city’s myriad of markets and vendors, below is what you need to try, and where. Some of the Northern Vietnamese dishes you should try include: BÚN CHẢ | A Hanoian specialty, Bún Chả is a delightful combination of grilled pork patties, slices of pork belly, a plate of white rice noodles (bún), and a side of herbs with a dipping sauce. Outrageously simple, and flavourful CHẢ CÁ | One of Hanoi's famous dishes, Chả Cá Lã Vọng involves seasoned fish, typically snakehead or catfish, grilled or fried with turmeric and dill, served with rice noodles and peanuts HÀ NỘI LA VONG FRIED FISH (CHẢ CÁ THĂNG LONG) | Similar to Chả Cá but is specifically known for its place of origin, Thang Long (old name of Hanoi), featuring fish marinated in turmeric and galangal, then fried and served with dill, coriander, peanuts, and dipping sauces PHỞ | The most iconic, Phở is a fragrant beef or chicken noodle soup with a clear broth seasoned with various spices, including star anise and cinnamon, usually eaten for breakfast BÁNH CUỐN | Our favourite breakfast option, these are delicate rice flour rolls filled with ground pork, mushroom, and shallots, often eaten with a dipping sauce made from a combination of fish sauce, sugar, and lime CÀ PHÊ TRỨNG (EGG COFFEE) | A unique Hanoian creation, egg coffee is made from robusta coffee, sugar, and egg yolks, creating a rich, creamy concoction that tastes like liquid tiramisu. You’ll die and go to heaven drinking this XÔI XÉO | A popular street food dish consisting of sticky rice topped with mung bean paste, fried shallots, and sometimes chicken, pork, or sausage PHỞ CUỐN | Essentially uncut phở noodles rolled with beef and herbs into a tight roll, served with a dipping sauce. It's a fresh, lighter take on the traditional phở NEM CUA BỂ (CRAB SPRING ROLLS) | Spring rolls filled with crab meat, pork, mushrooms, and vermicelli noodles, then fried to golden perfection. BÚN RIÊU CUA| A tomato-based soup made with crab and rice vermicelli, often enriched with tofu, water spinach, and fresh herbs. Here are some of the restaurants we suggest trying during your visit: PHỞ XÀO PHÚ MỸ | Non-descript and affordable street side cafe home to the aforementioned tapioca-based Pho, this was the best noodle soup we had in Vietnam (veg options available, too). Or maybe ever. Nom PHỞ GIA TRUYỀN BÁT ĐÀN | Basic, shop house located in the Old Quarter hiding some of the best Pho in Hanoi. Included in the Michelin guide, so you know it’s good, expect a long wait though, it’s popular here MIẾN LƯƠN CHÂN CẦM | A little restaurant that spills onto the streets of the old town, Miến Lươn Chân Cầm is famous for its stir-fried vermicelli with fried eel. It was absolutely packed with locals when we visited (always a good sign) BANCÔNG CAFE & RESTAURANT | One of Hanoi’s most popular restaurants for tourists, this bougainvillea-covered hotspot in the Old Quarter serves a mix of Vietnamese and international delights. It’s a great place to start your exploration of Vietnamese cuisine - just remember to snag a seat on the balcony HONG HOAI'S RESTAURANT | Another wildly popular, tourist-friendly Vietnamese restaurant in the centre of town. Serves all the favourites, including bun cha, which was a favourite meal here. A large vegetarian and vegan selection, too BANH MY MAMA | We have one rule for banh mi - the baguette must be crunchy. And the baguette at Banh My Mama is perfectly crunchy, and the ingredients are fresh and delicious. One of the better banh mi we had in Hanoi - a solid 8/10 BANH MI 25 | Popular, tourist-friendly Banh Mi store in the Old Quarter with a broad selection of traditional and modern fillings. A good starting point for your first sandwich PIZZA 4P’s | Pizza? In Vietnam? Surprising, yes, but Pizza 4P’s is honestly one of the best pizzas we’ve ever tried - so good we had it three times during our time in Hanoi. The menu, including the pizzas, are a mix of traditional and Asian-influenced, which result in a wonderful mix of flavours. Don’t sleep on the 4 mushroom pizza MAISON MAROU | Famed for its single-origin chocolate production, Maison Marou also serves up the best sweet treats in the city. Stop by for Paris Brest or tiramisu, and stock up on chocolate blocks for family at home DREAMERS AND SEEKERS | If you’re looking for a brilliant western-style brunch, Dreamers and Seekers is the best in town. We recommend the chilli scrambled eggs and the miso-honey mushrooms. In addition, they have the best-salted coffee/chocolate in Hanoi… absolutely delicious BOOK | This incredible 7-stop foodie tour of Hanoi STROLL THE IMPERIAL CITADEL OF THANG LONG A living, breathing part of Vietnamese history, the Imperial Citadel of Thang Long has borne witness to the ebb and flow of powerful empires. There’s quite a lot to unpack for a visit here. Firstly, it’s not just a citadel, but rather an archaeological site of UNESCO World Heritage significance. Secondly, it has been the centre of regional political power for 13 centuries. And finally, it houses recent colonial buildings that served as the Communist Party’s base during the Vietnam. All of this sounds pretty cool, right? Well, it is, but overall we found the site pretty underwhelming. The original fortress was built on this site in the 7th century by the Chinese, and although some of these remains are now visible through recent archaeological diggings, the current citadel, constructed in the 11th century by the Ly Viet Dynasty, is mostly what remains standing. You can walk through and over the imposing main southern gate (Doan Mon), where the second-floor terrace houses a palatial-style pavilion added during the Nguyễn dynasty, and provides some lovely views over the surrounding area. You can explore the historical Hanoi flag tower, but beyond that, there’s very little of the citadel that remains or excites. Behind the southern gate lies the remains of The Kinh Thien Palace, where King Le Thai To ascended to the throne in 1428, as well as the rather beautiful Lady’s Pavilion (Hau Lau) and the imposing North Gate (Bac Mon). All are interesting to look at, but again, there’s very little to experience. The French colonial section of the citadel houses the D67 Revolutionary House, which was the general headquarters of the Vietnam Communist Party during the war against the US. The preserved rooms and bunkers are probably the best part of the co", "images":

If the mustard-yellow streets of Hoi An could talk, we wonder what tales they’d tell. Would they recount the glory days of this ancient trading city, when the 15th to 18th-century trade winds beckoned vessels from the East and West to congregate at the river port known as Fai Fo; days when the air was heavy with the scent of spices and the chatter of tongues from a myriad distant lands? Perhaps its cobblestones would recall the echoes of rowdy sailors, the jangle of gold as it exchanged hands and was collected for the imperial coffers, or the tales of the artisans and migrants that followed the wealthy merchants to its pretty streets. Perhaps its walls would reveal Hoi An’s more sombre times, when the once-booming trade lines dwindled and those same merchants and businesses drifted away, returning it once again to its roots as a humble fishing village, albeit with the lasting marks of a once powerful cosmopolitan hub. These are the stories we ponder on an early morning wander through Hoi An’s famous lantern-filled alleys. Today, the UNESCO-protected yellow streets of Hoi An ring loudly with the sound of foreign tongues again, although the trade is of the modern mass tourism kind. Its antique centre brims with tailors and their touts, shops hawking counterfeit North Face and same-samey plastic trinkets, and cafes and bars jostle for attention with various coffee offerings and brunch menus. As the gloaming thickens over the Thu Bon each night, tourists flock to river boats to release thousands of colourful paper lanterns, the soupy dregs of which clogged its muddy banks each morning. While the efforts made to retain the city’s old-world charm architecturally are clear (and beautiful!), we have to admit we felt the same couldn’t quite be said for its rapid transition into a bit of a tourist trap (one-half of TCW visited in 2011 and was shocked at how tourist-centric it had become since!). Still, Hoi An’s streets, much like the weathered parchment once used to navigate them, still reveal the signs of their centuries-old history and the French, Chinese, and Japanese influences that shaped them — and they do make for delightful wandering for any traveller. Particularly in the gentle morning hours, before the cacophony, cyclos, and heat of the day take over! Here, we’ve shared our personal recommendations on the best things to do in Hoi An, along with a few things to know before your visit, our tips on where to stay, how to get around, and our favourite foodie spots in the city.

Thus, the hotels and hostels we’ve recommended below are outside the historic quarter. Thankfully though, it’s a short walk, ride or Grab into town. LA SIESTA HOI AN | A boutique hotel that delivers big on luxury and hospitality, La Siesta Hoi An is one of the best hotels in town and comes highly recommended by friends who stayed there. It features spacious, elegantly designed rooms, multiple dining options, and two stunning pools, and is a short walk from the historic old quarter. MULBERRY SILK VILLAGE | Where we stayed - Mulberry Silk Village is affordable, well-appointed, and served all our needs. Features huge rooms with a balcony, two swimming pools, spa facilities, and an on-site restaurant serving local and international cuisine, with a large breakfast buffet. HOI AN CHIC GREEN RETREAT | Set amidst the green rice fields just outside of the old town lies the stunning Hoi An Chic Green Retreat . This modern, eco-friendly hotel features thoughtfully furnished rooms and an outdoor pool that blends seamlessly with the surrounding rice fields. Also includes organic dining options in-house. MAD MONKEY HOSTEL HOI AN | Mad Monkey Hostel Hoi An is the home of hostel life in Hoi An, perfectly positioned near the ancient town. This backpacker hostel offers both dorm and private rooms and a party vibe perfect for solo travellers. THINGS TO DO IN HOI AN IMMERSE YOURSELF IN THE HISTORIC OLD TOWN Wandering through Hoi An’s old town for the first time is an undeniably charming experience. Its labyrinthine streets are flanked by mustard-yellow merchant houses and brightly coloured temples, where colourful lanterns dance in the midday sun and pink bougainvillea tumbles in waterfalls from balconies. Everywhere you look today there are examples of the foreign worlds that left their indelible marks on the town’s architecture, culture, and food; the Japanese Bridge, the Fujian Temple, and traditional Chinese houses dotted throughout the narrow streets. Strolling through these well-preserved streets today is as much a journey through the town’s unique history as it is a visual feast for the eyes. Part of Hoi An's attraction lies not just in its historical significance but in its transformation into a tourism hotspot. Its ancient former merchant buildings now host a myriad of shops, tailors, art galleries, and restaurants. While this can be pretty overwhelming at times, the trick is to look beyond the walls of replica North Face and discover the pretty facades, colourful windows, and cobbled laneways. To properly enjoy the old town, you need to arrive early and walk the streets before the crowds arrive. You’ll see the town at its most magical - a quiet, peaceful, dare we say it, tranquil place that time forgot. Start at the Japanese Bridge (Chùa Cầu) and head east along the main street of Tran Phu, before arriving at the Hoi An market . From here, make your way back along the uber-picturesque Nguyen Thai Hoc , before taking a slow walk along the waterfront overlooking the Thu Bon River (D Bach Dang) - these streets house most of Hoi An’s most beautiful examples of merchant houses, temples and market streets. Of course, don’t forget to duck down some of the quiet lanes and alleys to discover little gems all over the town. Come 11 am, the streets start to burst at the seams with selfie-wielding tourists and crazy cyclo-riders who zoom through the streets with little regard for the safety of others. It’s at this point we suggest heading for a long, lazy coffee. THE DETAILS Where | Hoi An Old Town ADMIRE THE COLOURFUL FUJIAN ASSEMBLY HALL Amidst the lantern-lit allure of this ancient town stands perhaps our favourite building in all of Hoi An - the colourful Fujian Assembly Hall. (Phuc Kien Assembly Hall / Hoi Quan Phuoc Kien - map ). One of the best things to do in Hoi An, the Fujian Assembly Hall was built in the late 17th century by Chinese traders from Fujian province as a place of worship that offered a sense of belonging and identity far from their native shores, and it has since transformed into a stunning temple dedicated to the revered sea goddess, to Thien Hau. When you enter the Fujian Assembly Hall you’ll first notice the beauty of the architecture, especially the ornate gates and the intricately-crafted dragon sculptures that adorn the facade. The hall interior features elaborate roof decorations and carvings, and a palette of colours that are so recognisable in Eastern culture. The altar itself contains a delightful mix of detailed carvings, gold accents, and offerings that fill the air with wafts of incense, while the walls surrounding the altar are decorated with murals showing scenes from historic Chinese mythology and folklore. For photographers and Instagrammers, this temple is heaven, full of details and colours that make your photos and videos pop. For normal travellers, it’s by far the most elaborate and beautiful temple in town. Before you visit, remember to purchase your Hoi An Old Town Ticket . THE DETAILS Where | Fujian Assembly Hall BOOK | This excellent walking tour visits the Fujian Assembly Hall EXPLORE HOI AN’S BUSTLING MARKETS Life starts early in Hoi An’s markets, where the scent of fresh seafood, tropical fruits, and aromatic spices awaken the soul at dawn's first light. As the sun casts its golden hues over the town, the markets come alive; locals hunt for the freshest produce, catch of the day, or steaming Banh Cuon for breakfast. The market colours are a feast for the eyes (and in our case, camera) - greens of basil and mint, the fiery reds of chilli peppers & freshly butchered meat, and the rainbow hues of local fruits and vegetables, all laid out in typical fashion. The centre of commerce and culture since its days as a thriving trading port, Hoi An’s markets have, at this point in time, remained surprisingly local and authentic, while the rest of the town has descended into a (very) tourist-friendly spectacle. A visit to the markets is one of the best things to do in Hoi An, and it’s one of the reasons why we suggest any intrepid traveller make a beeline for them to soak up the atmosphere. The best market to visit is the most popular - Hoi An Central Market, located right in the middle of the old town. It’s a thriving hub selling everything from fresh produce to handcrafted souvenirs. The eastern side of the market is home to fresh food, and where you’ll find the colour and chaos. The western side, closer to town, is filled with souvenirs, lanterns, ceramics and knick-knacks - slightly less authentic, but still great for gifts. For those interested in (very) local street food, the interior of the market is filled with a number of food stands, selling everything from Cao Lau to Banh Mi, and a heap of other local delicacies. As the day progresses and the morning rush gives way to the languid pace of the afternoon, the markets continue to buzz, so if you’re not an early bird, you can still get a feel of the atmosphere later in the day. Alternatively, a far more local market occurs every morning on the streets of Hung Vuong and the market hall of Vien Giac. It’s all about the fresh produce and flowers here, and we found it wonderfully intense and colourful. For a deeper understanding of Hoi An’s markets, we also suggest joining a cooking class (more on that below) which explores Hoi An’s markets at dawn. THE DETAILS Where | Hoi An Markets , Vien Giac TAKE A HOI AN GUIDED WALKING TOUR As independent travellers, the idea of walking tours usually fills us with dread. We’d much prefer to grab our cameras, wander aimlessly, and get a feel for a town without the whistle-stop nature of a tour. However, we really wanted to understand the depth and complexity of Hoi An’s history, so we booked a private guided walking tour and we’re so happy we did. Guided by a local expat with a deep knowledge of the town and province of Quảng Nam, we started our journey in the narrow, lantern-lined streets of the ancient town (previously known as Fai Fo), weaving through the laneways while stopping at the many obvious, and not so obvious attractions. Along the way, our guide, Robert, helped us understand the complex, deep and multicultural history of Hoi An, from the iconic Japanese Bridge and the town’s historical connections with Japan to the ancient homes and assembly halls of the early Chinese settlers and the history of the families that built them. From there, we explored the later arrival of European traders who introduced Hoi An to global trade and commerce between the East and the West, leaving a colourful mark on the town that exists to this day. We strolled through the buzzing local markets, found hidden gems, and ended the tour at a home of the Ngô family , masters of Hoi An’s Xí mà (black sesame soup), where we sampled this local delicacy on the arched colonial balcony. All in all, the perfect way to spend three hours, and we highly recommend you do the same. THE DETAILS BOOK | This highly-rated Hoi An walking tour SPEND A MORNING AT THE CHAM RUINS OF MY SON SANCTUARY Its name translates to ‘beautiful mountain’, and most travellers will certainly find themselves agreeing that against the backdrop of emerald green mountains and blue skies, the burnt orange ruins of Mỹ Sơn Sanctuary make for an emphatic feature of the landscape about an hour outside Hoi An. Where Hoi An was the trading port of the ancient Cham Kingdom (read more here ), My Son was its spiritual and political capital between the 4th and 15th centuries. Once home to over 70 Hindu temples offering deep insight into the country’s long and often ignored ancient past, unfortunately, war was not kind to the Sanctuary. Over just a few days in 1969, the ruins were almost entirely razed by US carpet bombing raids that reduced all but 20 or so of the temples to rubble. Thankfully, a combined international effort led to the site being UNESCO World Heritage protected since 1999, and recent restoration efforts have rebuilt some of the main highlights in painstaking detail. It’s certainly far more appealing than in previous years (Mark visited 10 years ago and was shocked at the change!). Plan your visit with our detailed guide. You’ll find the temples grouped from A - H, with an easy and accessible path that meanders through each section in the complex (it’s actually a very good path for prams for those with children!), taking in each temple group as well as lush forest and water features. Group A, once the most important crown jewel of the site is sadly still little more than rubble after being deliberately razed by US forces, while Groups B through H showcase the architectural and artistic genius of the Cham Kingdom through the centuries in the temples in various states of decay. Sure, they’re not as impressive as the nearby Cambodian ruins of Angkor Wat (to which they’re often unfairly compared), but without the heaving crowds, we found Mỹ Sơn Sanctuary a really enjoyable morning trip from Hoi An. There are a number of ways to visit Mỹ Sơn Sanctuary, although this tour is the best option as it arrives super early to avoid the crowds, which tend to descend on the ruins around 10 am. Alternatively, you can book a spot on a shuttle bus from Hoi An , take a public bus (note this doesn’t stop at the ruins though), or hire a private driver to make the hour-long drive to the Sanctuary, wait, then drive back to Hoi An, which will set you back around $30 USD. THE DETAILS Where | Mỹ Sơn Sanctuary Entrance Fee | 150,000 VND per adult, 30,000 VND per child (5 - 15 years old), Under 5’s are free Opening Hours | 6:30 am to 5:30 pm Read more | Our complete guide to visiting My Son Sanctuary BOOK | This morning trip from Hoi An to My Son Sanctuary or the public shuttle bus from Hoi An RELAX ON AN BANG BEACH Hoi An doesn’t necessarily hold its weight as a beach destination compared with the likes of Phu Quoc, Nha Trang or Mui Ne, but it does have a large stretch of coastline just outside of town which comes in very handy when you’re yearning for a couple of hours away from the searing heat of the old town. The best beach of the bunch, An Bang ( map ), is a long stretch of soft, white sand gently kissed by the clear waters of the East Sea. Flanked by palm trees, dotted with sun beds, and frequented by backpackers, it feels quintessentially South East Asia. The shoreline has many chic cafes and rustic bars, offering Western and local-style food, so if you're in the mood for a cocktail, local beer, or a seafood feast with a refreshing sea breeze, An Bang is worth the visit. Our favourite was the laidback Sound of Silence , a hostel cafe serving excellent coffee and decent food, with epic views. Alternatively, the Deck House An Bang has a Bali beach club vibe and excellent beach access. Fortunately, the beach is only a short bike ride (15 mins) away from the old town, or a 5 min Grab ride. Alternatively, if you’re looking to stay by the coast, Sound of Silence has simple, affordable homestay accommodation that you’ll never want to leave (Tan Thanh Garden Homestay - book here ).

First introduced by the French during their colonial era, today Vietnam’s coffee culture combines centuries-old brewing techniques with creative and contemporary approaches to coffee making. It makes for a brilliant coffee scene; everywhere from hipster cafes to nondescript street vendors serve rich, earthy, flavoursome Vietnamese coffee mixed (or topped) with sweet variations of milk, condensed milk, coconut, salted cream, or egg. Here in Hoi An, the favourite is iced coconut coffee. Perhaps more milkshake than proper coffee to true purists, it goes down as an absolute treat in the land of heat and humidity. Regardless of your preference, if you’re a lover of coffee, you really can’t go wrong in Hoi An. Below are a selection of our favourite coffee shops in Hoi An: FAIFO COFFEE Located in the heart of Hoi An's ancient town, Faifo Coffee is our favourite place to enjoy excellent coffee, including their drool-worthy coconut coffee. The standout feature though, is the rooftop terrace, which provides stunning panoramic views of Hoi An's rooftops and bustling streets, making it an ideal spot for enjoying a cup of coffee while soaking in the atmosphere. We suggest arriving early - pre 10 am, to grab yourself a rooftop vantage point. PHIN COFFEE Set off the bustling streets in a quiet and serene garden, is the highly popular Phin Coffee . Named after the phin, a traditional Vietnamese drip filter, the coffee here is exceptional - strong, robusta beans, served in whichever way you wish - our favourite being coconut coffee, while the rich, dessert-like egg coffee is widely popular. Other interesting options include peanut butter coffee. They also run coffee-making classes between 8:30 am -10 am daily (550,000 VND). NHA DAU Hidden far away from the masses is Nha Dau , a wonderfully quaint coffee shop where the walls are filled with books and plants. Serving simple, excellent coffees brewed traditionally and served with condensed milk over ice. Effective and highly delicious. The iced chocolate is also amazing, and don’t sleep on the banana bread. This cafe is also run by the most lovely family, and we spent quite a few lazy mornings just soaking up the peaceful, friendly ambience. CONG CA PHE You’ll notice Cong Caphe throughout Vietnam, and while it is a chain akin to Starbucks, they actually do really good coffee. The downtown location is housed in a beautiful old building so we suggest getting a seat outside and watching the world (tourists and bikes) go by. They’re most famous for their coconut coffees; strong coffee blended with crushed and coconut. It’s thick, sweet, and refreshing - always a winning combination in the heat of Hoi An! Keen to delve further into Vietnamese coffee culture? We recommend this coffee-making class in Hoi An . You’ll learn to make all the classic Vietnamese favourites, along with delving into what makes the coffee scene here so unique. ENJOY THE SILENCE AT REACHING OUT TEAHOUSE We found the chaotic nature of Hoi An’s old town quite overwhelming at times,", "images":

Discover famous attractions, ancient sites, sacred temples, the best food, and the chaos of Thamel with our comprehensive Kathmandu must - do list! There's just something about Kathmandu . From the moment we stepped off the plane on our first visit to Nepal , we really enjoyed our time in this bustling city. It's surprising because we're not usually fans of heavily polluted cities , nor ones that are claustrophobic, chaotic and exhausting. Despite the constant grumbles from motorbikes, annoying touts pushing trekking tours and hashish, and the painfully bad infrastructure, Kathmandu is endlessly appealing. The rabbit-warren streets of the backpacker district of Thamel are intoxicating, as are the surrounding alleyways which head seemingly in all directions, only to end in the same place. Despite the 2015 earthquake, Kathmandu's cultural and artistic history is prevalent just about everywhere, as are its historic temples and royal palaces, all waiting to be explored. And the food... don't get us started on the food, so delicious, so cheap. But what made the city just that little bit better were the people. Each person we met was so friendly and accommodating, despite the constant hardships of recent years. The city can be overwhelming to navigate and explore, and one day is certainly not enough to see all of Kathmandu’s top things to do; after three long visits here we are still discovering new parts of the city. If you're planning to visit Nepal but spend minimal time in Kathmandu, we suggest you change your plans and add at least two days to your stay in the city. It's worth it. You won't be short of things to do, and that's why we've put together our favourite places to visit in Kathmandu. LOVE OUR PHOTOS?

Going back in history, Nepal was actually split into three main kingdoms - Basantapur (Kathmandu), Bhaktapur, and Patan, each of which had a royal palace and surrounding Durbar squares located in the Kathmandu Valley. In the unified Nepal of today, each Durbar Square is made up of temples, idols, statues, open courts and fountains along with other structures. They are the perfect place to admire ancient Nepali architecture, Newari wood carvings and historic traditions. Oh, and it’s a great place to people-watch. These UNESCO World Heritage sites may have suffered more than most in Kathmandu during the earthquake, but they still retain the beauty and intricacy that made them so famous. It’s easy to spend a day exploring these squares and temples and we absolutely recommend it. We also recommend venturing out into the surrounding areas which are filled with quaint laneways and hidden temples/religious monuments. Below is an overview of each Durbar square in Kathmandu: KATHMANDU DURBAR SQUARE Kathmandu Durbar Square might have suffered more from the 2015 earthquake than most Kathmandu tourist sites, but it’s still an essential stop on any self-respecting traveller's what to do in Kathmandu checklist. And best of all, it’s super accessible, situated in central Kathmandu, just a 10-minute walk from the tourist hub of Thamel. The UNESCO World Heritage-listed Kathmandu Durbar Square is a stunning series of former beautiful temples and shrines, both Hindu and Buddhist, former royal palaces, courtyards, statues and ponds. The most impressive parts of the square are indeed the pagodas, which feature traditional Newari wooden carvings, some of which date back to the 16th century. Unfortunately, the majority of the glorious structures Mark saw on his first visit to Nepal in 2013 no longer remain, or are under reconstruction, but there are still a lot of interesting sites to see. These include: Jagannath Temple | The oldest and most beautiful structure in the complex, and most famous for its erotic carvings. Dates back to 1563 Hanuman Dhoka | The former Royal Palace was hit hard by the 2015 earthquake. You can walk into the courtyard, and see the Hanuman statue at the main entrance Kumari Ghar | Home of the Kumari, a girl selected to be the town’s living goddess and symbol of Devi, Hinduism’s concept of female spiritual energy. It’s unlikely you’ll see the Kumari (if you do, you’re very lucky!), but do check out the small courtyard, with beautiful carved wooden balconies and windows Kal Bhairav | A colourful stone image of Bhairav, representing the deity Shiva in his destructive manifestation. Great for watching locals performing religious practices Many of the ancient temples and structures were severely damaged in the 2015 earthquake, and when we visited again in 2019, the area resembled more of a construction site than a world heritage site. That being said, positive restoration work is being done, and it won’t be long before this area is back to its former glory. THE DETAILS Where | Kathmandu, south of Kathmandu, 5 mins from Thamel Cost | $10 – $15 USD to each, per person Book | Book your Durbar Squares day tour (includes all Durbar Squares! ) BHAKTAPUR DURBAR SQUARE AND THE OLD CITY OF BHAKTAPUR Whatever you do, don’t miss the pagodas, temples, palaces, narrow laneways and warm-brick facades of Bhaktapur. The ancient Newari city is, in our opinion, the most extraordinarily beautiful ‘city’ in Nepal. The UNESCO World Heritage-listed city is known for its artistry and crafts; walking the streets you’ll notice pottery makers, craftsmen, painters and carpenters doing their thing - we recommend buying your souvenirs here, where the quality is great and directly from the local Points of interest in the city of Bhaktapur that we recommend you visit include: Bhaktapur Durbar Square | The square is large and houses the 55 window Palace, Golden Gate, Pashupatinath temple/Pagoda, the Royal bath, Chyasalin Mandip, Siddhi Lakshi temple, Vatsala temple (currently being restored) Nyatapola temple | The tallest pagoda ever built in Nepal, this five-storey temple based on the five basic elements Dattatreya Square | Located in the older, east end, Dattatreya Square is our favourite square in Bhaktapur. Flanked by Dattatreya temple and an array of traditional Newari buildings, it’s quieter and more comfortable here, with far fewer tourists making it to this part of Bhaktapur Juju Dhau | Okay, this isn’t necessarily a place, but rather a local staple food - Newari yoghurt. Made from buffalo milk, it’s sweet and creamy and served in a traditional clay bowl. We could eat this all day… trust us! Pottery | In the south of the city there are a number of old men who go make pottery A visit here takes around 40 minutes from Kathmandu, but once inside the old town, including Bhaktapur Durbar Square, the streets are pedestrianised, providing a calmer atmosphere than Kathmandu Durbar Square. THE DETAILS Where | Bhaktapur, 40mins east of Kathmandu Cost | $10 – $15 USD to each, per person Book | Book your Durbar Squares day tour (includes all Durbar Squares!) PATAN DURBAR SQUARE The third of Kathmandu Valley’s UNESCO World Heritage-listed Durbar Squares is our favourite, with a distinct lack of souvenir stalls and touts giving a friendly, relaxed vibe. The locals treat it like their second home, with the benches and temples a meeting point for people of all types, from young lovers to groups of old men. It’s a fascinating place to people-watch - you could spend hours here watching the world go by (we did just that on our second visit here!). Like most of the classical Newari architecture found in the Kathmandu Valley, Patan was mostly constructed during the Malla period (14th - 18th centuries), leaving a Royal Palace, and assorted Hindu and Buddhist temples and idols surrounded by public squares. Some of our recommended sites to visit in Patan include: Patan Museum | Housed in the former royal palace, the museum exhibits objects and treasures from Nepal’s rich cultural history, including bronze and copper casts, and traditional crafts from Patan Krishna Mandir | The most impressive temple in all the Durbar squares, and Patan’s most important, Krishna Mandir houses a shrine to Lord Krishna, with shrines to Radha and Rukmini on either side Mul Chowk | Central courtyard of the Palace and the most beautiful of the three main chowks in the complex Like most historical sites in Kathmandu, Patan Durbar Square is still undergoing restoration post-2015 earthquake. THE DETAILS Where | Patan, 10mins south of Kathmandu Cost | $10 – $15 USD to each, per person BOOK | Book this popular Durbar Squares day tour (includes all Durbar Squares!) #2 EXPERIENCE KATHMANDU’S SPIRITUAL SIDE AT BOUDHANATH STUPA If you really want to experience Kathmandu’s spiritual side , Boudhanath stupa is a must . Dominating the local skyline, the eyes of buddha have gazed out over Kathmandu from the gilded central tower of Boudha Stupa since the 14th century. Festooned with Buddhist prayer flags, the whitewashed dome and all-seeing eye of Buddha are already impressive when viewed at ground level - and when viewed from above, the complex transforms into the shape of a Mandala and a tribute to Buddha’s path to Enlightenment. The UNESCO World Heritage-listed Stupa became the site of Tibetan Buddhism during the 50s when refugees from China immigrated to Kathmandu and based themselves in the streets and alleyways around the Stupa. Today, thousands of pilgrims visit each day to walk around the central dome, spinning prayer wheels as they go; Tibetan monks chant mantras and pray in the surrounding monasteries while tourists take it all in. In all honestly, give yourself an hour to sit on one of the benches and watch the world go by within the Boudha complex - it’s an intoxicating mix of incense, chanting, prayers, pilgrims, monks, tourists, and beggars. On the outside of the Stupa is Guru Lhakhan Gompa, one of the oldest monasteries in the Boudhanath area. It’s worth a quick visit, as Inside you’ll find beautiful statues of Guru Padma sambhava, Amitabha Buddha and Arya Avalokiteshwara, as well as Buddhists performing traditional and ritual activities. There’s also a brilliant view from the second floor. In our opinion, the best time to visit Boudhanath is during the late afternoon when the place has a more authentic feel. Locals go about their daily rituals and the surrounding area is less busy. Alternatively, visit early in the day to avoid the throngs of tourists. If you want the best views of the Stupa, as well as a cheeky lassi or chiya, check out Cafe du Temple or Stupa View restaurant rooftops. While the views are incredible, the prices are not, so expect to pay for the privileged position. THE DETAILS Where | Bouddha , Northeastern outskirts of Kathmandu, 20 mins from Thamel Cost | $2 USD per person Opening hours | 9:00 am - 17:00 pm every day BOOK | Spiritual Nepal guided day tour escape the chaos of kathmandu | our guide to the backpacker paradise of pokhara #3 VISIT PASHUPATINATH TEMPLE, ONE OF HINDUISM’S MOST IMPORTANT SITES Pashupatinath, even after numerous visits, still blows our mind s with its mix of religious, cultural and spiritual experiences. Here, you truly experience the intoxicating chaos and bustle of human (and Nepali) life, and the sacred Pashupatinath Hindu temple is a sobering reminder that all life eventually comes to an end. In existence since 400 A.D, Pashupatinath is dedicated to the god Shiva, and is one of the holiest sites in all of Hinduism, attracting hundreds of thousands of visitors each year. The complex itself is a swirling mix of smoke, chanting, and pilgrims; it’s one of the few living cultural heritage sites anywhere in the world. It includes 518 temples, buildings and structures, its main temple - a traditional pagoda structure, is considered a masterpiece in Hindu architecture. For westerners, you’ll have to view from outside as the temple is for Hindu devotees only. The main attraction here is the shining Shivalinga and the huge golden statue of Shiva’s Bull, Nandi. It’s also home to some pretty colourful artwork. Alternatively, the best views of the whole Pashupatinath Temple complex are across the river, on top of the series of pagodas. Just watch out for the monkeys in this part - they’re a little rabid. Pashupatinath ghat is also the location for many Buddhist and Hindu cremations, so you’ll likely see one of these taking places on the banks of the river. It’s a pretty confronting sight but incredibly interesting to witness. We recommend hanging around and watching the Aarti ceremony which commences each evening at 6:30 pm (see below!). Overall, the temple only suffered minor damage from the 2015 earthquake so can still be seen in all its glory. THE DETAILS Entry | Around $10 USD per person Location | Northeast Kathmandu, about 20 mins from Thamel Opening hours | 7 am - 7 pm daily BOOK | Spiritual Nepal guided day tour #4 EXPERIENCE A TRADITIONAL AARTI CEREMONY AT PASHUPATINATH TEMPLE As night falls gently over the Pashupatinath complex, a different hum of activity starts to rise; people line the far bank of the river, and an elaborate offering of music, chanting, incense, lights and camphor to Lord Shiva begins. The ceremony, known as Aarti, builds slowly until the whole crowd is on their feet, dancing as they chant and sing together in worship, and it’s impossible to resist being swept up in the energy of it all! The Aarti ceremony is one of the more important ceremonies in the Hindu faith; it always includes a flame or light, and generally involves the passing of an Aarti plate/lamp around a deity or person, and is accompanied by songs praising that deity or person. Watching an Aarti ceremony truly is one of the most unique experiences to have in Nepal. We recommend hanging around and watching the Aarti ceremony which commences each evening at 6:30 pm. THE DETAILS Where | Pashupatinath temple, Northeast Kathmandu, about 20 mins from Thamel Entry | Around $10 USD per person #5 ADMIRE SWAYAMBHUNATH STUPA (AND THE VIEWS OF KATHMANDU) Trust us; a visit to Swayambhunath (or Monkey temple) is one of the best things to do in Kathmandu . There may be a few stairs (365) and a heap of monkeys to navigate before you summit, but the experience and views are worth it. Perched atop a hill overlooking the whole of the city, Swayambhunath is one of Kathmandu’s most important religious sites. Functional since the 5th century, the Swayambhu complex consists of a stunning domed stupa, as well as ornate and beautifully decorated shrines and temples. A visit here is as enlightening as it is exciting. It’s a beautiful, if not slightly chaotic jumble of Hindu and Buddhist iconography; at the top, there’s a heady scent of incense and butter candles, ubiquitous prayer flags fluttering in the wind, and the hum of the sacred om mani padme hum (“Hail to the jewel in the lotus”). The stupa itself is the most symbolic structure in the complex - its dome represents the earth, while the gold, 13-tiered structure on its peak symbolises the 13 stages of nirvana. The base of the stupa is encircled by prayer wheels featuring the mantra om mani padme hum. There are also five ornate plinths around the Stupa which represent the five Dhyanai Buddhas and five qualities of Buddhist wisdom - Vairocana, Ratnasambhava, Amitabha, Amoghasiddhi, and Aksobhya. In the early evening, local monks and devotees circumnavigate the stupa, spinning each prayer wheel with vigour as they make their way through the ever-present smoky incense that hangs heavy in the air. This is definitely the best time to visit to truly experience Swayambhu at its most intense and beautiful. At the entrance to the temple complex, there’s also a fountain, which if you manage to throw a coin into the pot you can wish for something and with luck, the wish will come true. Mim somehow managed to get the coin in the pot and wished for world peace… something we’re still waiting on! The lofty hilltop provides the best vistas of Kathmandu, perfect for a sunset snap over the city below (smog/dust/weather permitting, of course!). Unfortunately, during the 2015 earthquake, the temple suffered a large amount of damage at the summit however the main structures are still standing and have been renovated and brought back to their former glory over the last few years. THE DETAILS Entry | Around $4 USD per person Location | Western outskirts of Kathmandu, about 20mins from Thamel BOOK | A day tour of Kathmandu, including Swayambhunath stupa Read our comprehensive guide to Nepal #6 SEE MT. EVEREST, WITHOUT HIKING IT! Let’s face it, most of us are never going to summit Mt. Everest (even Everest Base Camp is tough enough!), but there is an alternative… an epic scenic flight over the iconic peaks of the Himalayas, and of course Mt.Everest. Soaking up the incredible views of the majestic mountains from above, this flight kicks off (weather permitting) from Tibhuvan airport before soaring over the impressive snowcapped peaks of Nepal. The pilot will provide narration during your flight, pointing out the main peaks, and teaching you all about the spiritual significance of the revered Himalayan peaks. The holy grail though is the Everest fly pass, which will no doubt end in tears, 100+ photos, and major bragging rights amongst your friends and family. THE DETAILS BOOK | 1-hour Everest Scenic Flight Tip | Don’t forget to offset your flights - learn how to with our carbon offset post here nepal inspiration: why you need to visit nepal #7 JOIN A COOKING CLASS (FOR A GOOD CAUSE) IN KATHMANDU We always say that to truly experience a destination, you have to understand its food culture too - so most places we go, we try to take a traditional cooking class. In Kathmandu, we joined a cooking class at Seven Women , a social enterprise working to empower marginalised Nepalese women through skills training and literacy classes. For Nepali women, the kitchen is the heart of the home and we learned that it gives them a great sense of pride to share their food, culture and traditions with travellers from around the world. During our cooking class, we learned how to make traditional Nepali dishes, including a proper Nepalese curry (Dal Bhat!) from scratch using fresh local ingredients from Kathmandu Valley. Surprisingly, it tasted absolutely delicious. We then made a traditional rice pudding for dessert, which we’re both comfortable in admitting, was the best thing we’ve ever cooked. During the class, we also heard from Anita, our leader, all about the hardships faced by women in Nepal, and how things are slowly but surely improving across the country, especially with the help of social enterprises such as Seven Women. Not only is a traditional cooking class at Seven Women one of the best things to do in Nepal, it’s also a great way of supporting an enterprise that is helping empower Nepali women. THE DETAILS Where | Seven Women, Ranibari Marg Opposite to Manokranti Centre, Kathmandu Cost | USD $45 for a three-hour class Includes | Guided tour of Seven Women headquarters, lunch and drinks BOOK

Discover famous attractions, ancient sites, sacred temples, epic hiking and jungle safaris. UPDATED - JAN 2024 Welcome to the greatest country on earth: Nepal . A traveller’s nirvana unparalleled to anywhere else on earth, this land-locked gem has an overwhelming amount of things to do. Home to seven of the world's 10 tallest mountains, some of the best hiking and mountaineering imaginable, the birthplace of Buddha, steamy lowland plains and incredible wildlife viewing opportunities, ancient royal cities and rabbit-warren-like streets of Kathmandu , plus adventure activities to blow your mind (or cause a heart attack), and some of the kindest locals imaginable, the question of what to do in Nepal is one you could be forgiven for feeling overwhelmed by. But it’s one we’re here to help you answer. We’ve spent almost three months travelling through the country, which has felt like a whole lifetime too little, yet in that time we’ve trekked the Annapurna Circuit , Poon Hill , and Everest Base Camp, relaxed lakeside in Pokhara , navigated Kathmandu's craziness and somehow survived (and thrived), jumped off the highest tandem rope swing in the world, and searched for tigers on safari in Chitwan National Park. We’re here to tell you there are a lot of amazing things to do in Nepal, and although you almost certainly won’t have time to do them all, this guide is packed full of our recommendations for the top cultural highlights, outdoor adventures, and travel tips to help you enjoy your time here.

Boudhanath Stupa , is a vast 14th-century spherical Buddhist stupa that also proudly holds the dual titles of largest in Nepal and the holiest Tibetan Buddhist temple outside Tibet. Festooned with Buddhist prayer flags, the whitewashed dome and all-seeing eye of Buddha is already impressive when viewed at ground level - and when viewed from above, the complex transforms into the shape of a Mandala and a tribute to Buddha’s path to Enlightenment. Thousands of pilgrims visit each day to walk around the central dome, spinning prayer wheels as they go; Tibetan monks chant mantras and pray in the surrounding monasteries while tourists take it all in. The best time to visit Boudhanath is during the late afternoon when the place has a more authentic feel. Locals go about their daily ritual and the surrounding area is less busy, and the golden glow of the afternoon sun envelopes the stupa. After the 2015 earthquake, the main part of the stupa collapsed, however after restoration efforts to reinforce the structure, the eyes of buddha gaze out over Kathmandu from the gilded central tower. THE DETAILS Where | Bouddha, Northeastern outskirts of Kathmandu, 20 mins from Thamel Cost | $2 USD per person Opening hours | 9:00am - 17:00pm every day BOOK | Spiritual Nepal guided day tour #2 ADMIRE THE VIEWS OF KATHMANDU AT SWAYAMBHUNATH STUPA A visit to Swayambhunath (or Monkey Temple) is one of the best things to do in Nepal and an essential experience to have in Kathmandu Swayambhunath is a beautiful, if not slightly chaotic jumble of Hindu and Buddhist iconography; at the top, there’s a heady scent of incense and butter candles, and the hum of the sacred om mani padme hum (in which all of Buddha’s teachings are said to be found). The best time to visit is early evening when local devotees circumnavigate the stupa, spinning prayer wheels as they go and making their way through the ever-present smoky incense hanging heavy in the air. This lofty hilltop also provides the best vistas of Kathmandu , perfect for a sunset snap. There may be a few stairs (365) and a heap of monkeys to navigate before you summit, but the views at the top are worth it. From there, you’re greeted with an incredible view of bustling Kathmandu going about its day - a sight definitely worth the raised heart rate of the climb. Unfortunately, during the 2015 earthquake, the temple suffered a large amount of damage at the summit however the main structures are still standing and have been renovated over the last few years. THE DETAILS Where | Swayambhunath Stupa , Northeast Kathmandu, about 20 mins from Thamel Cost | Around $4 USD per person BOOK | A day tour of Kathmandu, including Swayambhunath stupa keep reading | everything to know before hiking the annapurna circuit #3 EXPERIENCE DEEP HINDU TRADITIONS AT PASHUPATINATH TEMPLE While Nepal is constantly abuzz with the intoxicating chaos and bustle of human life, the sacred Pashupatinath Hindu temple is a sobering reminder that all life eventually comes to an end. Pashupatinath, dedicated to the god Shiva, is one of the holiest sites in all of Hinduism and attracts hundreds of thousands of visitors each year. On the banks of the Bagmati river, Pashupatinath has existed since 400 A.D and its main temple is considered a masterpiece in Hindu architecture. For Westerners, you’ll have to view from outside as the temple is for Hindu devotees only. The main attraction here is the shining Shivalinga and the huge golden statue of Shiva’s Bull, Nandi. It’s also home to some pretty colourful artwork. Pashupatinath is also the location for many Buddhist and Hindu cremations, so you’ll likely see one of these taking place on the banks of the river. It’s a pretty confronting sight but incredibly interesting to witness. We recommend hanging around and watching the Aarti ceremony which commences each evening at 6:30 pm. The Aarti ceremony is one of the more important ceremonies in the Hindu faith; it’s full of colour, light and chanting and it’s totally worth staying for. Overall, the temple only suffered minor damage from the 2015 earthquake so can still be seen in all its glory. THE DETAILS Where | Pashupatinath Temple, Northeast Kathmandu, about 20 mins from Thamel Cost | Around $10 USD per person BOOK | Spiritual Nepal guided day tour #4 EXPERIENCE AN AARTI CEREMONY AT PASHUPATINATH TEMPLE As night falls gently over the Pashupatinath complex, a different hum of activity starts to rise; people line the far bank of the river, and an elaborate offering of music, chanting, incense, lights and camphor to Lord Shiva begins. The ceremony, known as Aarti, builds slowly until the whole crowd is on their feet, dancing as they chant and sing together in worship, and it’s impossible to resist being swept up in the energy of it all! The Aarti ceremony is one of the more important ceremonies in the Hindu faith; it always includes a flame or light, and generally involves the passing of an Aarti plate/lamp around a deity or person, and is accompanied by songs praising that deity or person. Watching an Aarti ceremony truly is one of the most unique experiences to have in Nepal. We recommend hanging around and watching the Aarti ceremony which commences each evening at 6:30 pm. THE DETAILS Where | Pashupatinath Temple, Northeast Kathmandu, about 20 mins from Thamel Entry | Around $10 USD per person BOOK | Spiritual Nepal guided day tour #5 EXPLORE THE KATHMANDU VALLEY’S ANCIENT DURBAR SQUARES No visit to Kathmandu would be complete without visiting the incredible UNESCO World Heritage-listed Durbar squares of Kathmandu. Going back in history, Nepal was actually split into three main kingdoms - Basantapur (Kathmandu), Bhaktapur, and Patan, each of which had a royal palace and surrounding Durbar squares located in the Kathmandu Valley. In the unified Nepal of today, each Durbar Square is made up of temples, idols, statues, open courts and fountains along with other structures. They are the perfect place to admire ancient Nepali architecture, Newari wood carvings and historic traditions. Oh, and it’s a great place to people-watch. Below is an overview of each: KATHMANDU DURBAR SQUARE Kathmandu Durbar Square might have suffered more from the 2015 earthquake than most Kathmandu tourist sites, but it’s still an essential stop on any self-respecting traveller's 'what to do in Nepal' checklist. And best of all, it’s super accessible, situated in central Kathmandu, just a 10-minute walk from the tourist hub of Thamel. The UNESCO World Heritage-listed Kathmandu Durbar Square is a stunning series of former beautiful temples and shrines, both Hindu and Buddhist, former royal palaces, courtyards, statues and ponds. The most impressive parts of the square are indeed the pagodas, which feature traditional Newari wooden carvings, some of which date back to the 16th century. Unfortunately, the majority of the glorious structures Mark saw on his first visit to Nepal in 2013 no longer remain, or are under reconstruction, but there are still a lot of interesting sites to see. These include: Jagannath Temple | The oldest and most beautiful structure in the complex, and most famous for its erotic carvings. Dates back to 1563 Hanuman Dhoka | The former Royal Palace, was hit hard by the 2015 earthquake. You can walk into the courtyard, and see the Hanuman statue at the main entrance Kumari Ghar | Home of the Kumari, a girl selected to be the town’s living goddess and symbol of Devi, Hinduism’s concept of female spiritual energy. It’s unlikely you’ll see the Kumari (if you do, you’re very lucky!), but do check out the small courtyard, with beautiful carved wooden balconies and windows Kal Bhairav | A colourful stone image of Bhairav, representing the deity Shiva in his destructive manifestation. Great for watching locals performing religious practices Many of the ancient temples and structures were severely damaged in the 2015 earthquake, however recent restoration efforts have begun to bear fruit, as a number of the temples are back to their former glory. THE DETAILS Where | Kathmandu Durbar Square, south of Kathmandu, 5 mins from Thamel Cost | $10 – $15 USD to each, per person BOOK | Book your Durbar Squares day tour (includes all Durbar Squares!) BHAKTAPUR DURBAR SQUARE The ancient Newari city of Bhaktapur, with its pagodas, temples, palaces, narrow laneways and warm-brick facades, is the most extraordinarily beautiful ‘city’ in Nepal. Founded in the ninth century, Bhaktapur ruled the Kathmandu Valley from 1200 - 1482, when the king, Yaksha Malla, divided the valley into three kingdoms - Bhaktapur, Basantipur (Kathmandu), and Patan. Quarrelling and oneupmanship led to a period of growth in culture, construction, artistry, and architecture from 1400 - 1800’s, leading to the stunning set of structures found today. The UNESCO World Heritage-listed city is known for its artistry and crafts; walking the streets you’ll notice pottery makers, craftsmen, painters and carpenters doing their thing - we recommend buying your souvenirs here, where the quality is great and directly from the locals. Points of interest in the city of Bhaktapur that we recommend you visit include: Bhaktapur Durbar Square | The square is large and houses the 55 window Palace, Golden Gate, Pashupatinath temple/Pagoda, the Royal Bath, Chyasalin Mandip, Siddhi Lakshmi temple, Vatsala temple (currently being restored) Nyatapola temple | The tallest pagoda ever built in Nepal, this five-storey temple based on the five basic elements Dattatreya Square | Located in the older, east end, Dattatreya Square is our favourite square in Bhaktapur. Flanked by Dattatreya temple and an array of traditional Newari buildings, it’s quieter and more comfortable here, with far fewer tourists making it to this part of Bhaktapur Juju Dhau | Okay, this isn’t necessarily a place, but rather a local staple food - Newari yoghurt. Made from buffalo milk, it’s sweet and creamy and served in a traditional clay bowl. We could eat this all day… trust us! Pottery | In the south of the city there are several old men who go make pottery A visit here takes around 40 minutes from Kathmandu, but once inside the old town, including Bhaktapur Durbar Square, the streets are pedestrianised, providing a calmer atmosphere than Kathmandu Durbar Square. THE DETAILS Where | Bhaktapur, 40mins east of Kathmandu Cost | $10 – $15 USD to each, per person BOOK | Book your Durbar Squares day tour (includes all Durbar Squares!) PATAN DURBAR SQUARE The classic Newari marvel, Patan is a far less-touristy and dare we say it, more attractive version of Kathmandu Durbar Square. Like most of the classical Newari architecture found in the Kathmandu Valley, Patan was mostly constructed during the Malla period (14th - 18th centuries), leaving a Royal Palace, and assorted Hindu and Buddhist temples and idols surrounded by public squares. Some of our recommended sites to visit in Patan include: Patan Museum | Housed in the former royal palace, the museum exhibits objects and treasures from Nepal’s rich cultural history, including bronze and copper casts, and traditional crafts from Patan Krishna Mandir | The most impressive temple in all the Durbar squares, and Patan’s most important, Krishna Mandir houses a shrine to Lord Krishna, with shrines to Radha and Rukmini on either side Mul Chowk | Central courtyard of the Palace and the most beautiful of the three main chowks in the complex The third of Kathmandu Valley’s UNESCO World Heritage-listed Durbar Squares is also the most authentic, with a distinct lack of souvenir stalls and touts giving a friendly, relaxed vibe. The locals treat it like their second home, with the benches and temples a meeting point for people of all types, from young lovers to groups of old men. It’s a fascinating place to people-watch - you could spend hours here watching the world go by (we did just that on our second visit here!). Like most historical sites in Kathmandu, Patan Durbar Square is still undergoing restoration post-2015 earthquake. THE DETAILS Where | Patan Durbar Square, 10mins south of Kathmandu Cost | $10 – $15 USD to each, per person BOOK | Book your Durbar Squares day tour (includes all Durbar Squares!) crazy and chaotic | our complete guide to kathmandu #6 ENJOY A COOKING CLASS WITH A DIFFERENCE AT SEVEN WOMEN, KATHMANDU We always say that to truly experience a destination, you have to understand its food culture too - so in most places we go, we try to take a traditional cooking class. In Kathmandu, we joined a cooking class at Seven Women , a social enterprise working to empower marginalised Nepalese women through skills training and literacy classes. For Nepali women, the kitchen is the heart of the home and we learned that it gives them a great sense of pride to share their food, culture and traditions with travellers from around the world. During our cooking class, we learned how to make traditional Nepali dishes, including a proper Nepalese curry (Dal Bhat!) from scratch using fresh local ingredients from Kathmandu Valley. Surprisingly, it tasted absolutely delicious. We then made a traditional rice pudding for dessert, which we’re both comfortable in admitting, was the best thing we’ve ever cooked. During the class, we also heard from Anita, our leader, all about the hardships faced by women in Nepal, and how things are slowly but surely improving across the country, especially with the help of social enterprises such as Seven Women. Not only is a traditional cooking class at Seven Women one of the best things to do in Nepal, it’s also a great way of supporting an enterprise that is helping empower Nepali women. THE DETAILS Where | Seven Women, Ranibari Marg Opposite to Manokranti Centre, Kathmandu Cost | USD $45 for a three-hour class Includes | Guided tour of Seven Women headquarters, lunch and drinks BOOK | Book a Seven Women cooking class #7 EAT ALL THE DELICIOUS NEPALI FOOD Don’t be worried by the quality or variety of food in Nepal because it’s incredibly good! Nom. For the local variety of snacks, start with Momos. The Nepali answer to dumplings, these pockets of joy come in vegetable, buff (buffalo) or chicken and can be fried or steamed. Our personal preference is steamed, served with a red chilli chutney. You can also find amazing Indian influences, such as pakora and samosas on any street corner! Next, find yourself some Choila, spicy grilled buffalo meat which goes down a treat with an ice-cold Everest lager. For larger meals, you really can’t go past Dal Bhat, the Nepali staple meal for lunch and dinner. Dal Bhat is a traditional Nepali meal consisting of rice, lentil-based soup and other condiments, and it’s generally all you can eat so you’ll never go hungry. For those who enjoy soups, our go-to favourite is Thukpa or Thenthuk, a delicious mix of meat, noodles and vegetables in a thick soup, from the mountains of Tibet. On the restaurant front, check out Yangling just outside of Thamel. It has the best Tibetan/Nepali cuisine in all of Kathmandu (we’ve tried almost everywhere!), at seriously cheap prices. RECOMMENDATION | For the best Nepali/Tibetan, visit Yangling restaurant . #8 JOIN A KATHMANDU FOOD TOUR “Where the hell are we going” we asked our guide, Sandib, as we walked through the rabbit warren laneways of Basantipur, Kathmandu’s old town. “To eat some delicious food, trust me” was his reply. He wasn’t wrong. After our third visit to Nepal, we were keen to learn more about Nepali cuisine away from the Westernised restaurants that dot Thamel and Freak Street, so we joined a Secret Food Tour with Backstreet Academy Meeting Sandib just outside Thamel, we began our tour at a local tea house located in an ancient bahas , or courtyard, where we sampled some of the local chiya (not chai!!, which we were quickly told off to say). Sugar high complete, we moved on, stopping at five epic, locals-only food stalls, where we tried a whole range of local delicacies. These included baras (traditional lentil pancakes), yomari (dumpling made out of rice flour and is filled with molasses traditionally), samosas with a Nepali twist, a Tibetan staple of momos, sweet and sour pani purri, and a thick, creamy lassi. It’s fair to say that each stop was a taste sensation; we just didn’t realise that Kathmandu had such a thriving street food scene. While the food was delicious (like, really delicious!), stepping off the well-worn tourist path and into local bahas and through narrow alleyways, while learning all about the history of Kathmandu from Sandib was an unexpected benefit. A word of warning though - if you’re taller than five feet, mind your head — in Nepal the mountains are high but the doorways are not. There is no doubt in our mind we would never have found these food stalls without this tour, and we highly recommend it as one of the best things to do in Nepal. THE DETAILS BOOK | This exceptional, and highly-rated Kathmandu street food tour﻿ #9 CHILL OUT IN KATHMANDU’S GARDEN OF DREAMS When the hustle and bustle of Kathmandu gets you down, pop into the Garden of Dreams just outside of Thamel for a relaxed oasis of tranquility. In this beautiful neo-classical garden you’ll find pavilions, verandahs, fountains and a relaxing amphitheatre where you can chill out on one of the pillows provided. It’s also evidently the romantic destination of choice for Nepalis, with lovebirds on every corner! There’s also the Kaiser restaurant which does a damn fine hamburger if you’re craving a western delicacy! THE DETAILS Where | 5 min walk from Thamel, Kathmandu Cost | $2 USD per person Read more | Our guide to Kathmandu's Garden of Dreams #10 ENJOY A COMMUNITY HOMESTAY IN PANAUTI If you’re keen for a super authentic Nepal experienc e, that empowers women and gives back to local communities, then you can’t miss a ", "images":

Our guide has everything you need to know about responsible travel in Nepal, including choosing sustainable tour operators, reducing your plastic, and how to empower women and support local communities while you’re there. The first time the two of us really questioned our environmental impact was in Nepal in 2016 . Specifically, on a bridge in Kathmandu overlooking the Bagmati River, watching aghast as a river thick with plastic, trash, and human sewage coursed its way under our feet. We were horrified. When we got home that night to see no less than 10 empty 1.5L water bottles lined up against the wall of our hotel room, it hit us: we were just as much a part of the problem. Needless to say, we knew then that we needed to make some pretty drastic changes to the way we travelled and lived. Since then, we’ve become huge advocates for travelling responsibly and minimising our footprint (while still having oodles of fun!) both on the road and at home. We’ve also been back to beautiful Nepal a number of times since — it’s our absolute favourite country in the world — and while (thankfully!) there have been huge strides made in cleaning rivers and managing waste, there are still a few responsible travel tips and things to know that all traveller to Nepal should be aware of. From how you can empower women and respect local customs, to how to trek with care and support local business, this guide to responsible travel in Nepal is full of absolutely everything you need to travel in a way that’s ‘good for all’; ourselves, the epic landscapes, and incredibly kind, welcoming Nepali people. RESPONSIBLE TRAVEL IN NEPAL: THE ULTIMATE GUIDE RESPONSIBLE TRAVEL | WHAT IS IT? Responsible tourism is all about having an active awareness of the effect that travel has on destinations and cultures around the world; both positive and negative. It’s about considering your own impact and that of the travel providers you choose and taking responsibility for ensuring that every facet of your travels, from the transport you take, the places you stay, the way you interact, and the companies and governments you support, are as sustainable as possible. It’s about travelling with awareness, kindness, and mutual respect for the world around you, making small choices with big impacts, and at least attempting to leave no trace of your wanderings. READ | Learn more about responsible tourism here RESPONSIBLE TRAVEL IN NEPAL | TREKKING We’ve already written a suuuuuper comprehensive guide with everything you need to know about responsible trekking in Nepal (you can read it here) , but in short, the issues around hiking and sustainability here are varied and complex. IS TREKKING IN NEPAL EVEN STILL ETHICAL? As visitor numbers continually increase, particularly in the Everest and Annapurna regions, so too do the problems that accompany them: littering and pollution , overtourism and crowding on trails , exploitation of local porters and guides , and environmental and cultural degradation. So is it still ethical to trek in Nepal? We believe yes. In our opinion, trekking in Nepal boosts the local economy and raises the standard of living significantly in one of Asia’s poorest nations. Not only should we not boycott it, we should actively be encouraging our fellow travellers to travel there. But we need to ensure that we’re encouraging them to trek in a responsible, respectful manner; one that considers their impact and works to benefit locals, the mountains, and tourists alike. In that way, you can support Nepal’s largest industry (tourism) in a healthy way, while not partaking in its unethical side. Here are our top tips to make that happen: TRAVEL WITH AN ETHICAL TREKKING COMPANY When booking your trek, ensure that you’re signing on with a company that reflects your own values (we travel with G Adventures ). Ask them about their environmental policies whilst on the trek, whether single-use plastic and waste management is a concern for them, and whether their staff (particularly porters) are paid fair wages, health benefits, and are given adequate trekking provisions and equipment. RESPECT YOUR PORTERS AND ENSURE THEY’RE TREATED FAIRLY Ensure that you’re supporting your porters by booking your tour with an organisation that provides its porters with the following: weather-appropriate clothing and protection, fair and stable basic pay, proper shelter and food provision whilst on trek, weight carrying restrictions and medical care. While we’re at it, if you decide to book a porter independently please don’t ask them to carry more weight for an extra fee. Respect that porters rely on being able to carry weight for their livelihoods; don't risk injuring them or their ability to support their families. TREK AT THE TAIL END OF THE TREKKING SEASON Trekking at the tail end of the peak trekking seasons will take the pressure of over-tourism and resource consumption off communities along the trek, as well as providing you with a more relaxed, enjoyable experience. OPT TO TREK LESS POPULAR TRAILS We’ve all seen the images of traffic jams on Everest, as climbers wait their turn in the death zone to reach the summit. While that’s an extreme example considering most leisure trekkers will never end up anywhere near those peaks, overcrowding is still very much a concern for the popular Everest Base Camp trek and the Annapurna region . Avoid contributing to over-tourism and waste management issues by option for a lesser-known hike like the Mohare Danda , Upper Dolpo , Kanchenjunga , and Mardi Himal treks. This also has the added benefit of spreading wealth more equally amongst Nepal’s rural communities. STICK TO THE TRAILS AND LEAVE NO TRACE A single wrong step off the trail by a boot can take years to regenerate again, which literally expands the impact of your footsteps long after you’ve gone home and the aches in your legs have dissipated. Leave the mountains are Mother Nature made them: stick to the marked trails, wait till you can go to the toilet at a teahouse instead of in nature, don’t litter, and pick up any trash you see along the way too. DON’T BARTER FOR YOUR ACCOMMODATION IN EXCHANGE FOR PURCHASING FOOD We’ve previously encountered travellers gloating about bargaining with teahouse operators to give them free accommodation in exchange for purchasing food in the mountains. Please, don’t be those travellers. Recognise the privilege that comes with being able to travel to Nepal and hike through its landscape (yes, even as a ‘poor’ backpacker!), and that many of the communities here rely upon the income made from tourism for survival. Empower communities, don't exploit them. READ | If you’re keen to know more about accommodation in Nepal, check out our guide here RESPONSIBLE TRAVEL GUIDE TO NEPAL | PEOPLE DON’T BUY WEED In Kathmandu particularly, you can barely take more than a few steps before being harassed by a tout asking if you want some hash. Aside from being super annoying after a while, on our recent trip in May this year, we also saw a worrying number of very young kids touting it too, which means it’s obviously become an easy way for criminals and gangs to entice young, vulnerable children away from their education and into crime. Buying weed from these sellers directly funds this, which is no good for anybody. And if you’re that desperate - it grows pretty wild all over the country, particularly in the lower reaches of the Annapurna region …! DO RESEARCH BEFORE VOLUNTEERING Wanting to give back to the communities you visit on your travels is a really kind-hearted and admirable gesture. However, while numerous organisations globally work hard to make meaningful, sustainable contributions to their community, there are just as many that, unfortunately, exist solely to profit off our ‘do-gooder’ instincts. It’s a hard lesson to learn, but sometimes our well-intentioned voluntourism actually does a lot more harm than good . In a country like Nepal, still grappling with issues of extreme poverty, gender inequality, and of course, the ongoing recovery from the 2015 earthquake , it’s absolutely imperative that you do your research thoroughly if you decide you simply must volunteer your time while there. Look for organisations that: Are reputable, ethically-driven, and sustainably-minded Are focused on empowering community groups from within, rather than creating a cycle of dependency Don’t offer short placements or disruptive visits, particularly when vulnerable children are involved Do offer roles that are aligned with the type of work you want to do, or the Are transparent and honest about where donor money goes In our view, supporting volunteer organisations by attending a social enterprise’s workshop or class (look at our empowering women section below for more information!), donating gear (e.g. to the Nepal Porter’s Association ), or making donations to social enterprises employing local staff is far more beneficial to Nepali people anyway. CHOOSE ORGANISATIONS THAT EMPOWER WOMEN AND CHILDREN Tourism that also empowers women and works towards gender equality is incredibly relevant - and necessary - in countries like Nepal, where a woman’s role has remained very traditional and the society is still highly patriarchal. Did you know that in most regions of the world, women make up the majority (up to 60%) of the tourism workforce, but tend to be concentrated in the lowest status, lowest/unpaid roles? These include cleaning, cooking, and unpaid work in family tourism businesses. Gender equality is a hugely important step not just in improving human rights, but also in achieving sustainable progress for developing nations. After all, women make up half of the population, and if their voices, skills, and talents aren’t recognised appropriately, no society can develop to its full potential. How can you support women on your next trip to Nepal (and beyond)? Seek out and actively support female-led businesses, tours, cafes, etc Travel with brands like G Adventures , who actively support social enterprise on all of their tours through the Planeterra Foundation Purchase local handicrafts and gifts from women’s cooperatives (this also helps to keep traditional crafts alive!) Visit social enterprises (we’ve listed our favourite ones in Nepal below!) that focus on empowering and supporting female empowerment Here are a few of our favourite social enterprises focused on female empowerment in Nepal: SASANE SASANE (Samrakshak Samuha Nepal) is a survivor-led organisation that combats human trafficking (a major issue in Nepal) by training its survivors as paralegals. When they graduate, they work placements in police stations in Kathmandu and Pokhara, and in turn, become the first point of contact for other female victims. SASANE also run outreach and education programs across rural villages in an attempt to prevent trafficking at the source. SASANE also worked with Planeterra (G Adventures foundation) to launch the Sisterhood of Survivors program , where travellers can join the women for a traditional mo:mo dumpling and thali lunch-making class, and the SASANE Sisterhood trekking program , which trains survivors as trekking guides and tour operators. PANAUTI COMMUNITY HOMESTAY PROJECT One of our all-time favourite experiences in Nepal was visiting the Panauti Community Homestay project (read about our visit here ), which brings travellers to Panauti, a small village in the foothills of the Kathmandu Valley, for a few nights to experience like in a real, rural Nepalese community. What’s more, it’s female-led, empowers women to move beyond the home and their family duties to take a more active role in society, and empowers them as businesswomen and community leaders in a traditionally patriarchal society. 3 SISTERS ADVENTURE TREKKING Another female-led organisation that’s turning the traditionally male-dominated trekking industry on its head, 3Sisters Adventure Trekking trains women from disadvantaged backgrounds to become guides. In doing so, they empower marginalised women to become financially and socially independent, and self-sufficient, and confident decision-makers. Trekking with a female-led, female-operated company like this helps to change the world, one woman and girl at a time. SEVEN WOMEN NEPAL In Kathmandu, we took a cooking class at Seven Women , a social enterprise working to empower marginalised and disabled Nepalese women through skills training and literacy classes. For Nepali women, the kitchen is the heart of the home and we discovered that it gives them a great sense of pride to share their food, culture and traditions with travellers from around the world. During our class, we learned how to make traditional Nepali dishes, including a proper Nepalese curry (Dal Bhat!) from scratch using fresh local ingredients from Kathmandu Valley - and it was delicious! Book your cooking class here DON’T GIVE MONEY OR GIFTS TO BEGGARS (PARTICULARLY KIDS) We know it’s well-intentioned and comes from a kind-hearted place, but nothing makes us more frustrated than seeing other travellers give money, pens and pencils, chocolate, and gifts to beggars and street kids. Do not ever give money, pens, chocolate, or gifts to beggars. In fact, this is one of the worst things you can do as a responsible traveller. Giving money to child beggars actively encourages kids to beg, which in turn keeps them out of school, places them in danger by perpetuating the belief that tourists are safe and wealthy, and encourages organised begging syndicates and human trafficking groups to kidnap (and sometimes disfigure) young, vulnerable children to work for them . Giving candy can cause health issues in a country where access to dental hygiene and medical attention is lower for disadvantaged locals, and pens or toys are likely to be resold for cash. We know it’s heartbreaking, we know you wish there was something you could do to help. But the most constructive thing you can do in those moments is NOT giving money, but investing your time and effort into a social enterprise uplifting these societies from within. PAY FAIRLY AND BARGAIN RESPECTFULLY Guys, we totally get it - we don't want to be ripped off when we travel either. We’ve been to enough places now to know there are different prices for locals and tourists in many countries around the world, and that haggling is part of the culture for many of those. One of the greatest reasons to travel around in Nepal (or anywhere!) is that you can help distribute money into rural communities and towns that may otherwise have gone without. While bargaining in markets and haggling prices is super commonplace, be fair and respectful about how low you force the locals you're haggling with to go. Aim to pay the fairest price, not the cheapest, and remember fun interaction and a few dollars to you can often also unwittingly carve away a chunk of a shop owner’s much-relied-upon income. By being able to travel, you’re already privileged - the least you can do is pay that forward by positively supporting the livelihoods of those locals whose homes you’re visiting. BE RESPECTFUL WHEN PHOTOGRAPHING Nepal is an extremely photogenic destination . From the epic landscapes (think thick jungles, chaotic cities , and soaring mountain peaks), right through to the extremely welcoming people, fascinating culture, and plenty of wild animals, there’s something guaranteed to catch your eye at every turn. Before you go clicking the shutter though, there are a few things to know about responsible photography in Nepal. This is a culturally conservative country, and the majority of the population are deeply religious or spiritual. Always ask permission before photographing local people , (particularly the older generation), and be aware that photography is banned in many temples and religiously significant sites. To photograph responsibly wherever you are in the world is to place yourself in the subject’s shoes, and think about whether you’d feel it was appropriate if someone took a similar photo of you. Would you be okay with you or your loved ones being snapped in that moment? Is the shot morally or ethically inappropriate, or exploitative in any way (ie of children, or locals ‘down on their luck’)? Did you seek permission? If you can’t answer all of these questions honestly, then you might need to rethink your shot. SHOP, STAY, AND EAT LOCAL By choosing to sleep, eat, and travel like a local, you support local families and economy, keep money within Nepal , drastically reduce your carbon footprint, and also tend to have a much richer, more authentic travel experience. Where possible, stay in locally-owned guest houses instead of large, foreign-owned energy-intensive hotels, take local public transport instead of hiring a private car, and buy from local grocers, shopkeepers and craftspeople. A few of our favourite locally-owned, sustainable hotels in Kathmandu are: Nepal Pavillion Hotel | Pretty much our favourite place to stay in Kathmandu, this quaint, Newari-style hotel has beautiful rooms, is located in the heart of Thamel and has the most wonderful hosts; a few brothers who have worked tirelessly to bring their vision for a locally-owned, designed, and culturally-focused hotel to life. BOOK | Nepal Pavilion Hotel Traditional Comfort Hotel | Large, clean rooms, brilliant morning breakfast, and a commitment to only working with local suppliers and craftspeople, Hotel Traditional Comfort really is a comfortable, enjoyable stay. Located just outside of Thamel, but far quieter in the evening which is a big bonus.

When visiting its holy sites and temples, it’s important to take note of a few basic customs to show your respect: Always navigate clockwise around temples - and yes, that means walking around the temple again to get to something behind you, if needed! Always remove your shoes when entering temples or a local’s home. Shoes are considered the most degrading form of clothing, so this is an important one Some temples are only accessible to those who follow Hinduism or Buddhism. Make sure you read the signage before you go ahead and walk-in Always check if it’s alright to take photographs inside temples - this is generally sacred ground, and while some will allow it, others will ask you to put your camera away Keep your displays of affection to a minimum (as in, don’t have them here at all), and keep your voice down RESPECT THE LOCAL CULTURE Nepal is culturally quite conservative, and much of the local customs are tied up in their deep spirituality and religious belief s. Respect that other people and places may view the world very differently from you and that their customs might feel unfamiliar or uncomfortable as you experience them. But just because something is different or you don’t agree with it, doesn’t necessarily mean that it’s wrong or your way is better. Treat locals how you’d wish to be treated as a guest, take your cues from how they behave and dress (no short shorts outside of Thamel!), avoid getting too drunk or obnoxious, and always travel with respect at the heart of your adventures here. LEARN THE CUSTOMS AROUND FOOD Get ready for some insanely mouthwatering food on your travels to Nepal! One of the things we love best about travelling here is that it’s not just polite to eat with your hands here but expected. We’re all for throwing our cutlery in the air and eating exactly how our parents told us not to!

Discover the best budget, mid-range and luxury accommodation options with our comprehensive where to stay in Kathmandu list! UPDATED - JAN 2024 The main gateway to the incredible Himalayan mountains , steamy lowland jungles, stunning UNESCO world heritage sites, and of course some of the greatest hospitality on earth; Kathmandu is impossible to avoid if you visit Nepal . The rabbit-warren streets of Thamel are intoxicating, as are the surrounding alleyways which head seemingly in all directions, only to end in the same place - Kathmandu Durbar Square. Kathmandu's cultural and artistic history is prevalent just about everywhere, as are its historic temples and royal palaces, all waiting to be explored. And while it might be a little polluted, incredibly chaotic, and overwhelming at times, there's no denying Kathmandu is an enjoyable city to spend a few days in. If you're planning to visit Nepal but spend minimal time in Kathmandu, we suggest you change your plans slightly. Trust us; as travellers who've cumulatively spent almost four weeks in the city, we definitely think it's worth visiting for at least four days, and likely more. You certainly won't be short of things to do in Kathmandu , nor will you be short of places to stay in Kathmandu. Ranging from high-end to the barest-of-bare backpacker accommodation, we've personally stayed in MANY different hotels, hostels and guesthouses (upwards of 20!), so we feel like we know all the possible options within the city. This guide is designed to help you find the perfect accommodation option for your needs, based on budget, location or amenities. So, if you're wondering where to stay in Kathmandu, which area is best, or which hotel to book, we've got you covered. LOVE OUR PHOTOS?

There are hundreds of hotels, guesthouses, and hostels in town; therefore, if you’re a budget traveller or backpacker, you’ll likely stay in this part of town. You will love spending time in Thamel; It’s a great place to hang out and meet fellow travellers, walk the streets and soak in the atmosphere that only really exists in this area. It’s also right in the heart of town, close to all of the major things to do in Kathmandu . BHAKTAPUR The historic city of Bhaktapur, home to Bhaktapur Durbar Square, is located around 40 minutes from the centre of Kathmandu. While it might be a little away from all the major sights within Kathmandu , it’s a great place to stay and explore the old city, which is well-preserved and incredibly beautiful. PATAN Home to one of the famous Durbar Squares of the Kathmandu Valley, Patan is one of the most beautiful parts of Kathmandu. Although there’s not a huge amount of accommodation in Patan, hotels here tend to follow Newari design and have a traditional feel. If you’re looking for a more authentic location in which to stay, don’t miss Patan. LAZIMPAT Located just outside of Thamel is Lazimpat, home to numerous high-quality and luxurious hotels. It’s also far more chilled out and quieter than Thamel, and therefore a little bit more comfortable. Fortunately, its location in the centre of town is still close to all the main attractions and restaurants Kathmandu has to offer. READ | The 21 best places to visit in Kathmandu READ | The Garden of Dreams, Kathmandu’s garden oasis READ | Our complete guide to accommodation in Nepal WHERE TO STAY IN KATHMANDU: ACCOMMODATION TO SUIT EVERY BUDGET Kathmandu has a huge range of accommodation options to meet any budget (we’ve written a complete guide to accommodation in Nepal to help you out - read it here !). Most properties are located centrally, primarily around the Thamel district, or Lazimpat. LUXURY HOTELS IN KATHMANDU DWARIKA'S HOTEL The best place we’ve ever stayed in Kathmandu, Dwarika’s Hotel is a collection of former traditional heritage Nepali houses formed around a courtyard near the centre of town. Staying here feels like you're stepping back in time and worth the (very) expensive cost. Rooms are large, and feature traditional architecture and details, while the surrounding gardens and pool are exquisite. Oh, and the restaurant is one of Kathmandu's best - definitely order a Nepali feast of an evening, post-hike. BOOK | Dwarika’s Hotel KATHMANDU MARRIOTT One of Kathmandu’s newest hotels, the contemporary delights of Kathmandu Marriott are somewhat jarring against the traditional Kathmandu vistas. However, this isn’t necessarily a negative thing - Kathmandu is in need of luxury hotel options, and the Marriott nails the brief. Minimal, spacious rooms feature stunning city and mountain vistas and provide elevated comfort after a long hike in the famed Nepali peaks. There are several restaurants and bars on-site, which offer a range of global and Asian cuisines. Additionally, there’s a rooftop infinity pool that has astounding views over the city - we suggest grabbing a cocktail and watching the sunset from the rooftop. Located near many of the city’s famed attractions, the Kathmandu Marriott provides an extraordinary escape in Nepal's capital. BOOK | Kathmandu Marriott HOTEL SHANKAR Hotel Shankar is a historic luxury heritage hotel located in the Lazimpat district of Kathmandu. Once a royal palace, the hotel was opened in 1964 in a building dating to 1894 and is a truly unique place to stay in Kathmandu. The rooms are elegant and feature a touch of traditional Nepali decor. In terms of amenities, the pool is on another level - definitely a great place to relax after hiking, while the restaurant offers local and international cuisine. BOOK | Hotel Shankar HOTEL YAK & YETI A Kathmandu icon, the Yak and Yeti Hotel offers a delightful blend of luxury and history in the heart of the city. Set amongst lush gardens in a beautifully restored palace, the rooms are tasteful, featuring traditional architecture with modern amenities for an elevated level of comfort. The pool and surrounding gardens are a key feature of the property, while the on-site restaurants are among the finest in Kathmandu. Located near major attractions like Durbar Marg and Thamel, the Yak and Yeti provide an ideal base for discovering the rich culture and heritage of Kathmandu. BOOK | Hotel Yak & Yeti CROWNE PLAZA KATHMANDU-SOALTEE Located on 12 hectares just outside of Kathmandu, the Crowne Plaza Kathmandu-Soaltee is a truly 5* experience in Kathmandu. Although probably more for businessmen than hikers, it’s still a seriously deluxe hotel. BOOK | Crowne Plaza Kathmandu-Soaltee Or, search for luxury hotels in Kathmandu here the top places to visit in Nepal | 21 amazing things to do MID-RANGE HOTELS IN KATHMANDU KATHMANDU GUEST HOUSE The first place we ever stayed in Kathmandu was right here, at the famed Kathmandu Guest House. It was pre-earthquake, so things were a little different then, but it’s always remained a favourite of ours. Located in the heart of Thamel, the iconic hotel offers a range of room types in many different wings. We’d suggest booking in the historic, original part of the complex for a more authentic stay. The key feature of the hotel, though, is the expansive lawns which house hikers, tour groups and well-heeled locals throughout the day. This hive of activity makes it a special place to meet respective travellers, and it’s a great place to grab a coffee. While not the finest place we've stayed, it's the perfect mid-range guesthouse right in the heart of Thamel, and often BOOK | Kathmandu Guest House NEPAL PAVILION INN One of our favourite places to stay in Kathmandu, the quaint, Newari-style Nepal Pavilion Inn hotel is located in the heart of Thamel, just a short walk from Kathmandu Durbar Square and other major city-based attractions. The rooms are simple yet, well-appointed, and the beds are super comfortable - some of our best post-exploring sleeps were in these very beds. Additionally, the hosts are some of the best we’ve encountered in Nepal - pure hospitality from our arrival. Highly recommended. BOOK | Nepal Pavilion Inn HOTEL TRADITIONAL COMFORT Large, clean rooms and a brilliant morning breakfast, Hotel Traditional Comfort is a really enjoyable place to stay. Located just outside of Thamel, but it’s far quieter in the evening allowing for a good night’s rest. BOOK | Hotel Traditional Comfort Or, search for mid-range hotels in Kathmandu here BEST BUDGET HOTELS IN KATHMANDU HOTEL HOLY LODGE It’s the location, right in the heart of Thamel, and massive rooms, that make Hotel Holy Lodge the best budget accommodation we’ve stayed at in Kathmandu (we’ve stayed in about 10 different places!). However, our recommendation comes with a word of warning - request a room at the rear of the property for a quieter night’s sleep. BOOK | Hotel Holy Lodge YAKETY YAK HOSTEL In a city devoid of backpacker hostels, Yakety Yak is a welcome addition to Kathmandu’s accommodation scene. A new, modern hostel right in the heart of Thamel, it’s a little pricey for a hostel, but the vibe and modern rooms make it worth it. BOOK | Yakety Yak Hostel ZOSTEL KATHMANDU Relaxed hostel located in Thamel, including an awesome rooftop terrace. Rooms are nice, especially for the price, and the hostel has a really cool garden and bar which is a great place to meet fellow travellers. BOOK | Zostel Kathmandu ALOBAR 1000 HOSTEL While not as comfortable and modern as Yakety Yak Hostel, the Alobar1000 hostel is the perfect place to meet fellow travellers on their awesome rooftop. The staff are friendly, the vibe relaxed, and the prices are fairly cheap. The rooms are… not bad, but you’re not here for comfort, right? Also located in Thamel.

Prices will vary quite substantially across the peak seasons and regions, but for the most part, accommodation will set you back between $5 - $35 per night. If you’re travelling outside of high season, prices can drop, so always ask if any discount is applicable. Below is an overview of accommodation in Kathmandu (read our Nepal accommodation guide for a more thorough overview!): GUESTHOUSES Almost all accommodation is referred to as a ‘guesthouse’, and there are varying levels of guesthouses in Nepal, from extreme budget to very well appointed. Guesthouses that cater to tourists are well organised: most innkeepers speak excellent English and can arrange anything for you from laundry to trekking/porter hire (which comes in very handy). Nepal, and especially in Kathmandu, may have daily power cuts (less than previously, but it still occurs quite regularly - read more in our in-depth Kathmandu guide ). This often means no hot water or electricity for up to eight hours, so we recommend checking whether your guesthouse of choice has a generator for constant hot water and continuous electricity. BUDGET GUESTHOUSES This is probably the best option for budget backpackers and the type of accommodation we spent most of our time in. Budget guesthouses in Kathmandu are generally cheap and cheerful but with enough of the bare essentials to make life okay. Most provide hot running water (if you’re lucky!), flush toilets, clean sheets and blankets. If you go outside the main tourist areas, be prepared to do with a lot less, including hot water. But for the low prices, they’re generally worth it. MID-RANGE GUESTHOUSES Mid-range guesthouses are generally larger and better appointed (think fan/Aircon, TV). Prices can be almost triple the price of budget guesthouses, however in many cases, such as after a long trek, it’s absolutely worth it. To gain the cheapest prices, we definitely recommend doing some research on Booking.com before booking. HOTELS AND RESORTS If you're looking to splurge, there's a good range of very respectable hotels and resorts in Kathmandu. While not of the standard of resorts in southeast Asia or Europe, hotels and resorts in Kathmandu are decent enough if you do your research. Prices are far cheaper than many similar properties around the world, so if you have the budget, stay somewhere nice such as Dwarikas Resort in Kathmandu. AIRBNB A relative newcomer to the Kathmandu accommodation scene, Airbnb is available across the country, ranging from swish apartments in Kathmandu ( honestly, we couldn't believe our eyes at how beautiful some were ), to authentic homestays in the countryside. READ | Our guide to Airbnb (includes free booking code!) HOW MUCH DOES ACCOMMODATION COST IN KATHMANDU Not sure where to stay in Kathmandu? Fortunately, the city has a huge range of accommodation options to meet any budget. Most properties are located centrally, primarily around the Thamel district. Prices vary dramatically, depending on where you stay and when. The most common form of accommodation – guesthouses, will set a charge between $5 – $35 per night. If you’re travelling outside of high season, prices can drop, so always ask if any discount is applicable. On the whole, accommodation in Nepal is pretty standard. Most places have a range of rooms, from budget to doubles with en suite. Beware, that cheaper accommodation is of a poor standard; if you’re backpacking, this might be okay, but otherwise, invest a few extra dollars for something nicer. Average prices for accommodation in Kathmandu: Bed in hostel dorm | NPR 800 - 1,500 Guest houses | NPR 400 - 2,500 3* double room | NPR 2,000 - 8,000 Luxury accommodation (4 - 5*) | NPR 15,000 - 25,000 NEPAL BACKPACKING ESSENTIALS Travelling through Nepal comes with a unique set of needs.

Here’s all the essential information you need to successfully trek Poon Hill yourself. Completely Updated - July 2024 If you've made it to Nepal , there's a pretty good chance that you're keen for an epic hiking adventure - a brilliant decision considering eight of the world’s 14 highest peaks tower can be found here! We’re firm believers that getting into the Himalayas is the best way to understand this beautiful country. A good portion of the population dwells in the small towns dotting the mountain-sides, and much of the country’s religions, languages, and culture originate from their valleys and peaks. Beyond epic views and personal triumphs, it’s the opportunity to explore this culture that makes trekking one of the most popular things to do in Nepal. For those who have limited time in Nepal but want to get to the mountains and experience the unique Nepalese culture, we cannot recommend the Ghorepani Poon Hill trek (sometimes also known as the Annapurna Panorama Circuit) highly enough. This three-day trek is essentially a microcosm of what a longer Nepalese mountain trek is like. You’ll pass through quaint villages, thick jungles and over rivers, and up many, many stairs before ultimately ending up at altitude (3,200m), with your head amongst the tallest mountains in the world. We hiked the Poon Hill trail ourselves recently, and we’re now sharing our insider knowledge on tours and cost, trekking advice (including how to do it responsibly!) with you in this super comprehensive guide. From deciding which season to trek in, how fit you need to be, everything you need to know about trekking permits, what to pack and leave at home, and what the teahouses are really like, we’ve got you covered. Here’s everything you need to know before tackling the Poon Hill trek yourself! LOVE OUR PHOTOS?

We’re starting this Poon Hill Trek guide in a slightly alternative fashion - by answering whether or not the trek is actually worth it? We feel like the below information is pertinent as to whether or not this is the right trek for you, and what you wish to achieve. If you’ve only got a short time in Nepal but want to see the famous Himalayan Range and experience Nepal mountain culture, the Ghorepani Poon Hill trek (sometimes known as the Annapurna Panorama Trek) is exactly what you’re looking for. This three-day trek is essentially a microcosm of what a longer Nepalese mountain trek is like. You’ll pass through quaint villages and the unique local cultures of the Gurung and Magar communities; up many, many stairs, through jungles and over rivers; before ultimately ending up at altitude (3,200m) with your head amongst the tallest mountains in the world. The views from Poon Hill are some of the best we’ve ever experienced - uninterrupted, panoramic views of some of the largest and most photogenic Himalayan mountains, including Dhaulagiri, Nilgiri, Machhapuchhare, Annapurna II and Lamjung. It also happens to be the spot where the two of us got engaged - so we can definitely vouch for how epic a place it is! It’s super accessible from Pokhara as the official starting point is just 1.5 hour’s drive from the lakeside town and at 3-4 days long it really is the perfect way to ease yourself into trekking in Nepal without committing to 16+ days on a trail (like the Annapurna Circuit! ). What’s more, it’s affordable - treks to Poon Hill start at around USD $240. Now, if you’re looking for something longer, more challenging, or perhaps a less busy trail, there are several alternatives, not just from Pokhara but also in the Solukhumbu region (Everest). If time is limited, but you’d prefer a less popular route, the Ghandruk Loop Trek (4 - 5 days), the Mohare Danda Trek (5 - 7 days), or the Khopra Danda Trek (6 - 9 days), offer great alternative options. But, they are slightly longer in length and days. The Annapurna Circuit Trek , as well as the Annapurna Base Camp and Annapurna Sanctuary treks, are longer, more challenging, and really get amongst the incredible mountain ranges you can see from Poon Hill. But, they take far longer (upwards of 10+ days), so you really need time on your side to fully appreciate them. If you have the time, then choose one of these - being immersed in these mountains for more than 10 days does wonderful things for your soul. The same goes for hikes in the Everest region including Everest Base Camp and Gokyo Lakes hikes - they’re mostly 10+ days, and while incredible, eat up a lot of time. Pound for pound though, the Pook Hill Ghorepani trek provides the views, the culture, and the challenge in a short duration, and that’s hard to beat. BOOK | Hike Poon Hill with this highly-rated guide POON HILL TREK | ESSENTIAL INFORMATION WHERE IS POON HILL & WHERE DOES THE POON HILL TREK START? Poon Hill is located in the Annapurna region of Nepal and is globally renowned as one of the most popular trekking destinations in the world. The jaw-dropping landscapes and astonishingly tall mountains, including the Annapurna Massif (Annapurna I, Annapurna South, Gangapurna, and the iconic Machapuchare) form the backdrop to many treks, including Poon Hill. They will take your breath away (pun intended). The reason for the popularity of the region is that it spans a variety of different ecosystems, from subtropical forests to alpine meadows, which provides a diverse range of hiking experiences, and you’ll pass through many of these on the Poon Hill Trek. Thankfully, unlike the long and bumpy bus rides to the commencement of the Annapurna Circuit, or the fear-inducing flights to Lukla, the Poon Hill trek train head is easy to get to, via a 2-hour mini-bus ride from Pokhara to the small village of Nayapul (although you might find some routes commence in Ghandruk). WHEN IS THE BEST TIME TO HIKE TO POON HILL? The peak trekking season for Poon Hill is between September - November and then March-May. It's still possible to hike in December and January, but be mindful that winter conditions will make for an icy adventure (temperatures can drop below -15c during peak season!), while May is the start of the monsoon season and signals an increase in potentially wet days. The best time to hike Poon Hill is during April when the famous Rhododendrons are in full bloom , the views stunning, and the weather comfortable. We trekked at the end of May (May 23-25 to be exact!) and were lucky with the weather. It was hot through the morning and early afternoon, but by the time we reached our teahouse in the late afternoon/evening, the heavens would open with a huge downpour that cleared the heat away. The temperatures were mild enough that we didn’t need a sleeping bag (though you absolutely would during peak season). We were also gifted crisp, perfect (and we mean p e r f e c t ) sunrise views at the summit point, which was ideal considering that’s also the ridiculously perfect spot Mark chose to pop the question at 😉 NOTE | If you want to complete Poon Hill as part of a longer Annapurna Circuit or Annapurna Base camp trek, you’ll need to stick to the peak trekking times for these (October to early December, then February through to April) as heavy snow or monsoonal rains prevent hiking in the higher reaches of these trails outside peak season. POKHARA: A guide to the backpacker paradise of Pokhara POON HILL TREK - GUIDED OR SOLO? Amongst those who come to Nepal for an epic hiking adventure a fierce debate rages: should you trek in Nepal with an organised group, or simply heave on a rucksack full of your gear and take to the trails alone? The two of us believe that both options are totally viable here, and like anything, each has its own unique advantages and disadvantages. There are plenty of people who opt to trek solo in Nepal, and it really is a perfectly manageable feat. Personally, we’ve only ever opted to take a guided tour (more on that below), although now that we have a few hikes and experience under our belt, we might also consider going solo next time. HOWEVER. In early 2023, the Nepali Government banned independent trekking in the country and mandated all international hikers hire a guide (read more here ). The decision was made to boost employment and increase safety for tourists visiting the famed mountain ranges. You’ll now need to source your guide through trekking agencies registered with TAAN (Trekking Agencies Association of Nepal), which represents more than 2,000 government-approved companies (see our recommendations below). In addition, TIMS and ACAP Permits will no longer be issued without a registered guide. And you know what, we understand it - tourism accounts for a large proportion of GDP & jobs in Nepal, so the move makes sense. The move has caused some derision amongst locals, especially in the Solukhumbu region, where they’ve outright defied the mandate, citing the financial burden of local guides, and lack of obvious improvement in infrastructure. The new mandate isn’t necessarily enforced across Nepal, from the research we’ve done. Alas, we suggest booking with a registered agent or tour for all your Nepali treks, including Poon Hill. BOOKING YOUR GUIDED POON HILL TREK We booked our Poon Hill trek with Nepal Wilderness Trekking a few days before our departure and would highly recommend them. Our guide, Riddhi, was brilliant, everything went seamlessly, and our accommodation was bordering on luxurious. They’re also locally owned, which makes them an even better choice, in our view. If you’re keen to do Poon Hill as part of another trek (like say, the Annapurna Circuit or Annapurna Sanctuary), here are a couple that include it in their longer itineraries: G Adventures | Annapurna Circuit trek (18 days, Kathmandu to Kathmandu). Prices and availability here . G Adventures | Annapurna Sanctuary trek (15 days, Kathmandu to Kathmandu). Prices and availability here . Other | You can also search for specific Nepal Travel Tips | What to know before visiting Nepal TREKKING PERMITS AND TIMS PASSES FOR THE POON HILL TREK You’ll need to have both a Trekking Information Management System (TIMS) permit and an Annapurna National Park Permit (sometimes also known as the Annapurna Conservation Area Permit or ACAP) for the Poon Hill trek. The cost of these will be incorporated into your trekking fee and the whole process (organising them and carrying them through the trek) will be managed by your guide. For trekkers going it alone, the permits will set you back about USD $40-50 (depending on currency fluctuations). The ACAP Permit is USD $25 / NPR 3,000 per person, while the TIMS Permit is USD $15 / NPR 2,000 per person. You’ll need to carry these permits with you at all times on the trail, as they’ll be checked at various checkpoints along the way. Trekking permits can be organised either at the Nepal Tourism office (map here ) based in Kathmandu , or the Pokhara tourist office (Map here ) before you begin the trek. To purchase each permit, you will need the following: A valid passport Valid travel insurance (buy yours here) 4 passport photos (we suggest printing many before you depart your home country) A contact person or hotel in Nepal HOW MUCH DOES THE POON HILL TREK COST? Treks to Poon Hill are also super affordable compared to some of the longer treks in Nepal . We paid $240 (USD) per person, which seems to be around the starting point for guided treks; although this is very much dependent upon what time of year and who you book with too! Included in the cost of our tour was the following: Accommodation 3 meals per day + tea/coffee breaks Guide Porter Taxi from Pokhara to Nayapul for the start of the trek Taxi back to Pokhara at the end of the trek ACAP Permits + TIMs registration Trekking solo / without a guide will obviously be quite a bit less as you’re not paying guide and porter wages, but you will have to manage your permits + trek organisation yourself. We’d recommend budgeting somewhere around $40-60 per person, per day if you’re planning to go solo (and probably more in peak season). NOTE | You’ll also have to pay a NPR 100 entrance fee at the Poon Hill gate, so don’t forget to slip some cash in your pocket for summit morning! BOOK | Book your guided Poon Hill Trek here HOW DIFFICULT IS THE POON HILL TREK? We’re definitely not in the prime of our fitness right now, but the two of us were able to complete the Poon Hill trek perfectly fine. This is classed as an easy-moderate trail, and as it starts and ends at a relatively low altitude there aren’t too many physical requirements. That said, while a moderate level of fitness is fine you’ll need to be able to manage being on your feet for 4-6 hours a day for a few days in a row, and make sure you’re fine with stairs and steep hills. On the topic of stairs though: be prepared to walk up and down lots and lots and lots of the little buggers! There are over 3,500 stairs from Tikhedunga to Ghorepani, all different heights and shapes, which make for a painful day hiking up, and an even more knee-crunching day when you have to tackle them on the descent. Regardless of the trek difficulty, always make sure you travel with up-to-date travel insurance in case you slip and hurt yourself, or the unexpected happens. We travel with HeyMondo , who provide comprehensive travel + medical insurance, an app with 24-hour medical support, and no out-of-pocket fees (get 5% off your policy by booking through our link here ). BOOK | Click here to get the best deals with HeyMondo IS THE POON HILL SUNRISE WORTH IT? Most people plan their trek so that they ascend Poon Hill in the pre-dawn and watch the sunrise over the mountains in front of the lookout. But is it really worth the early start? Uhh… YES . Just look at the photo below! Take it from this non-morning person; this is one early start you absolutely want to get up for. While we’re pretty sure that the views would be epic at any time, watching the sunrise over the Annapurna range and some of the largest mountains in the world is a humbling, awe-inspiring experience we won’t be forgetting any time soon. WHAT’S THE ACCOMMODATION LIKE ON THE POON HILL TREK? We’ve covered everything you need to know about accommodation in Nepal in this post , but briefly: the teahouses speckled along the hiking trails aren’t the Shangri-La, but they are charming little things made from stone and wood and a cosy place to relax at the end of a long day’s trekking. Generally, rooms are twin-share, with more than enough space to spread out. Most have separate shower and toilet facilities — although our teahouse in Ghorepani had an ensuite replete with hot showers! — and there’ll also be a communal area that doubles as a dining hall with either a fireplace or boiler to cosy up next to an evening. It’s also pretty customary to eat your evening meal at the same teahouse you’re staying at, and they’ll generally ask you to order your food as you check-in. In terms of charging your gear, there are generally spots to charge in the communal space, and you may need to pay a small fee to use these. READ | Our complete guide to accommodation in Nepal, including our recommendations WHAT’S THE FOOD LIKE ON THE POON HILL TREK? We basically lived off veggie Thukpa (noodle soup) during our trek as it’s one of our favourite Nepalese/Tibetan dishes, but you’ll find a great mix of Nepali and Continental food along the trail. Better yet, the food is organic and grown in the hills surrounding the local communities, so it’s beautifully fresh and exactly the kind of nourishment you need for your trek. Honestly, we haven’t had a bad meal in the mountains, and there are days we dream about sitting outside on a crisp sunny day and enjoying a beautiful Nepali feast. You’ll find prices will increase the higher you climb, but expect to pay around NPR 500 for Dal Baht, NPR 300 for a bowl of Thukpa, NPR 200 for soups, and NPR 450 (veg) - 600 (meat) for a tasty plate of Momos. GHOREPANI POON HILL TREK ITINERARY & OUR OWN EXPERIENCE The Poon Hill trek is officially listed as a 4-7 day trek because it depends on how much time you want to spend in the mountains and the route you want to take. One of the most popular routes takes you from Nayapul to Ghandruk; we opted for Nayapul to Nayapul (actually technically we finished in Bantanthi as that’s where the car collected us). We did the trek in 2 nights, and 3 days, and felt this was a doable feat, although descending the entire way down the stairs in one day turned our legs to jelly (and had us walking funny for an entire week after!). If you do have more time and flexibility than we did, we’d definitely recommend the 5-day hike option that takes you through Tatopani and Ghandruk on your way back to Pokhara . Here’s what our Poon Hill trek itinerary looked like: DAY #1 | POKHARA TO TIKHEDUNGA (VIA NAYAPUL, THE START OF THE TREK) Starting point | Nayapul (1070m elevation) Finish point | Tikhedunga (1580m elevation) Total ascent | 540m Distance trekked | ~10 km Time trekking | 3-4 hours Our trekking adventure begins with meeting Riddhi (our guide) and Ura (our porter) before a 1.5-hour car ride from Pokhara to the trek’s official (and most popular) starting point: Nayapul. Nayapul is a gorgeously quintessential Nepalese rural trekking town; layers of farmland carve the lower mountain slopes surrounding the town, while the main street is abuzz with activity. Mothers gather on steps trying to tame their children’s hair, and men sit and chat in the town centre. A steady stream of trekkers make their way through with smiles and nods to each other, and there’s just a hint of adventure in the air. We cross a suspension bridge and have our Permits and TIMs cards checked at the Bantanthanti checkpoint before beginning the 3-hour trek to our home for the evening: Tikhedunga. The walk is peaceful and follows the Bhurungdi Khola River through peaceful farming villages and lush mountain valleys. Every now and then a jeep bounces past on the dirt road, ferrying tourists higher up to the town of Hille (the furthest point you can get by car on the Poon Hill trail). So far, the slow ascent is totally manageable, although our unfit bodies are definitely feeling it. We stop for a (delicious) veggie noodle soup lunch in Lambdawi. The day is already hot and humid, so it’s back on the trail soon for the final 1.5-hour hike into Tikhedunga. From here, the ascent is steep, although the quaint villages, cute Himalayan mountain dogs, and beautiful scenery definitely make up for it. Eventually, we arrive in Tikhedunga right as monsoon storm clouds begin to roll in. Our accommodation Tikhedunga Guest House, right at the end of the village is comfortable, pretty, and right beside three waterfalls - a peaceful oasis we’d happily stay in for days. Dinner is Thukpa, Momos, fresh fruit, and masala chai before heading to bed by 8 pm to the sound of rain on the roof. DAY #2 | TIKHEDUNGA TO GHOREPANI Starting point | Tikhedunga (1520m elevation) Finish point | Ghorepani (2853m) Total ascent | 1360m Distanc", "images":

Here’s our comprehensive Kathmandu to Pokhara transport guide, including all the practical information you need to get between Nepal’s two largest cities. UPDATED - JAN 2024 The idea of travelling from Kathmandu to Pokhara fills us with dread. It’s a trip we’ve done many times and one which we absolutely hate. The bus ride from Kathmandu to Pokhara is long, windy, dusty, precarious, and completely arduous (it’s Nepal … the roads aren’t great here!). You’ll read online it takes 6 hours, and when buying a ticket you’ll be told the journey to Pokhara takes 6-7 hours. WRONG. At best, you’re in for a 8-hour journey, which seems crazy when the distance between the two cities is just 200 km. That’s Nepal for you (the Himalayas have a lot to do with it, too!). The alternative is jumping aboard one of Nepal’s notorious airlines for the 30-minute flight, or an expensive private transfer. Whichever way you choose, the journey from Kathmandu to Pokhara is one of the hardest in Nepal (read our Nepal travel guide here ). That being said, things are improving. On our most recent journey to Nepal in June 2019, the premium bus service had upgraded their coaches, which are now air-conditioned and far more comfortable. While the Prithvi Highway is still poor, parts have been upgraded; the span of the highway from Dumre to Pokhara is now actually pretty good (as of 2024, the road is undergoing another upgrade, which is increasing travel time once to 12+ hours again). We believe Pokhara is absolutely worth visiting (it’s actually one of our favourite places in Nepal , and you’ll need to start your Annapurna Circuit hike there too), so getting from Kathmandu to Pokhara is a necessary evil. That’s why we’ve put together this guide on how to get from Kathmandu to Pokhara (and Pokhara to Kathmandu). It covers everything you could need, including all the options, prices, and tips for travelling in between Nepal’s two major cities. Oh, and one more thing… good luck (you’ll need it!) HOW TO GET FROM KATHMANDU TO POKHARA: TOURIST BUS, FLIGHT, OR JEEP KATHMANDU TO POKHARA BUS (INCLUDES KATHMANDU TO POKHARA TOURIST BUS) Over our three trips to Nepal , we’ve caught the buses from Kathmandu to Pokhara, and Pokhara to Kathmandu too many times to remember, and in our opinion, catching the ‘tourist’ bus is the easiest and most cost-effective way to get from Kathmandu to Pokhara. We’ve used several different services, all of which provide about the same level of quality. VVIP buses are the safest and best option for the Kathmandu to Pokhara bus route. They offer modern buses with air-conditioning and device charging capabilities, professional (and safe) drivers, as well as lunch on their Kathmandu to Pokhara (and return) route. In the past, we’ve used cheaper services such as Prithvi, World Touch and Blue Sky. These services are fine, however, the buses are outdated, aren’t air-conditioned, and are sometimes driven by drivers who’d do better spending time on a Formula 1 track than driving the winding, dangerous road from Kathmandu to Pokhara at such high speed. In short, they’re bloody scary. THE KATHMANDU TO POKHARA ROUTE The bus ride itself slowly makes its way out of Kathmandu, up the mountain roads that surround the city. It’s fairly precarious, especially as you make your way down into the valley; the narrow corners and steep descent are sure to test the nerves. The route passes several small villages and rural towns, and the scenes from the window are always enough to stay awake and watch this foreign world pass by. The midway point is often River Side Springs Resort, which also doubles as a lunch spot. The food is standard roadside fare - Dahl bat, vegetable noodles, mixed veggie curry, and chicken curry. Tea and coffee is included. The road to Pokhara from Kathmandu crosses the Trishuli bridge through Dumre before another windy, slow, two-hour drive to Pokhara . HOW LONG DOES THE KATHMANDU TO POKHARA BUS TAKE? Depending on who you’re talking to, the bus from Kathmandu to Pokhara should take around 6-7 hours, however we’ve never found this to be true. On average, expect a travel time of at least 8 - 9 hours. We have had instances where the trip has taken upwards of 12 hours (yes, 12 hours!), however there were road works which slowed the journey down. Either way, expect the unexpected and allocate 12 hours; if you arrive early, it’s a blessing. HOW MUCH DOES THE KATHMANDU TO POKHARA BUS COST? Tickets for the Kathmandu to Pokhara (and Pokhara to Kathmandu bus) cost between: | NPR 700 (USD $6.50 - $7) and NPR 2,800 (USD $25) The price discrepancy comes down to a multitude of factors, including safety, comfort (air-conditioning), supplied lunch, and a guaranteed seat. Below is a breakdown of two services we recommend: VVIP For the higher-end bus companies, lunch (Nepali Dal Bhat, noodles etc. at a hygienic restaurant), a bottle of water (we decline these to reduce plastic ), onboard wi-fi (which never works) and charging points are included in the ticket price. Air-conditioning is also a feature, which is a blessing during the warmer months, and the seats are also very comfortable. We recommend paying the NPR 2,800 (USD $25) as you can’t put a price on safety, especially so in Nepal. The drivers are well trained and always apply a safety-first mentality on the roads, which is more than we can say for a number of the cheaper tourist buses that value early arrival times ahead of passengers’ lives. BOOK | Book bus tickets VIP/TOURIST BUS The cheaper bus companies use older buses to service the Kathmandu to Pokhara route, so don’t expect any air-conditioning, wi-fi or charging points. The seats are manageable, however make sure you get a seat number as part of your ticket - there are often scams whereby tourists aren’t provided with ticket numbers, and are forced to sit in the rear on the most uncomfortable seats, or stand part of the way. Most of the cheaper tourist buses stop along the way for lunch, which may or may not be included in the ticket price (check at time of booking). Bus drivers are often a little more haphazard in their approach to safety, which can lead to some pretty hair-raising encounters on the windy roads towards Pokhara. BOOK | Book bus tickets DO I NEED TO PRE-PURCHASE A BUS TICKET? We tend to always book our Kathmandu to Pokhara bus tickets a day or two in advance. Why? During peak season, the Kathmandu to Pokhara bus route is one of the most popular, so tickets can sell out days in advance. In the past, it was only possible to book tickets from Kathmandu to Pokhara via a travel agency or through the bus company directly, but you can now purchase online at 12GOAsia . We recommend buying tickets online here or from the myriad of local travel agencies in Kathmandu. BOOK | Book your Kathmandu to Pokhara bus tickets here DEPARTURE POINT FOR THE KATHMANDU TO POKHARA BUS Tourist buses from Kathmandu to Pokhara depart from Sorhakutte at the tourist bus park at 7 am each morning (here’s a map for the Sorhakutte Tourist Bus Park ). Sorhakutte is located about 10-15 mins from Thamel, and costs around NPR 100-200 via taxi. Tourist buses also drop you back at the same point on the return trip from Pokhara to Kathmandu. This is a recent change, as buses used to depart from Kantipath bus stop, just outside of Thamel (we were almost caught out by this change, having caught the buses from Kantipath on all of our previous trips to Nepal). For both Greenline and regular bus services, it’s important to arrive at least 20 minutes before the bus departure time. read more | the best things to see and do in pokhara ARRIVING INTO POKHARA All buses arriving in Pokhara from Kathmandu drop you off at Pokhara Tourist Bus Park ( map here ), around 15 minutes frown Pokhara Lakeside via taxi (or around a 45-minute walk). Upon arrival, you’ll be met with literally hundreds of taxi drivers asking for your business. Push through, grab your bags and make your way outside the tourist bus park before committing to a taxi fare. The fare should cost between NPR 200 - 300 however the Pokhara taxi drivers are known to charge large fares for short rides, so confirm the fare before entering the taxi.

Water | We always take at least 2 litres of water on the journey. We don’t buy bottled water, but instead use our Grayl water filtration and purification system , which allows us to fill up from any water source without fear of getting sick.

There are around 20 flights per day, lasting around 25 minutes. It’s a super scenic flight, with views of the Himalayas throughout, so beyond the quick journey, you’ll have an awesome sightseeing flight, too. One thing to consider is that flights are often delayed or cancelled due to poor weather, or because of delays with incoming flights, so be prepared to wait around a little. BOOK | You can book your Kathmandu to Pokhara in advance flight here COSTS AND BOOKING DETAILS FOR THE KATHMANDU TO POKHARA FLIGHT Flights from Kathmandu to Pokhara (and Pokhara to Kathmandu) cost between USD $100 - $200 depending on availability during peak season and can be booked through any tour agency in Nepal. We recommend booking well in advance to reduce the ticket costs and to guarantee a seat. Off-season, flights can be as little as $50-60 is booked at the last minute, from any of the tourist agencies in and around Thamel and Kathmandu. There are three major domestic airlines: Nepal Airlines, Buddha Air and Yeti Airlines, all of which are considered the safest to fly. WHERE DOES THE KATHMANDU TO POKHARA FLIGHT DEPART FROM? All flights from Kathmandu to Pokhara depart from the domestic terminal of Kathmandu’s Tribhuvan Airport. The domestic terminal is located to the left of the International terminal as you enter the airport grounds ( map here ). The departure terminal for the morning flights can be a little chaotic due to the flights to Lukla, so keep an ear out for your departure announcements. READ | Learn all about Nepal with our Nepal Travel Guide WHERE DOES THE POKHARA TO KATHMANDU FLIGHT DEPART FROM? All Pokhara to Kathmandu flights depart from Pokhara domestic airport, located 5 km away from Pokhara lakeside. The airport is easy to get to, with taxis from Lakeside costing around NPR 300. IS FLYING IN NEPAL SAFE? Air safety in Nepal is poor to say the least, with an average of one fatal accident occurring each year. We recommend booking your flight for an early morning departure when the visibility is generally good, and crashes are less likely to occur. travel better in nepal | our top nepal travel tips and advice KATHMANDU TO POKHARA BY PRIVATE CAR / JEEP If time and money aren’t an issue, hiring a private jeep for the journey from Kathmandu to Pokhara is a good idea. For around USD $250, you can hire a whole Jeep (up to eight seats), which when divided by multiple passengers, becomes a fairly cost-effective solution It’s also a more comfortable experience, where you can spread out amongst your group, and control when and where you stop on the way. If you’re looking into this option, its best to inquire at one of the tourist agencies in Kathmandu or Pokhara. crazy kathmandu | 21 incredible places to visit in kathmandu NEPAL BACKPACKING ESSENTIALS Travelling through Nepal comes with a unique set of needs.

{"url": "https://www.thecommonwanderer.com/blog/we-got-engaged-in-nepal", "title": "That Time We Got Engaged in Nepal: The Best Day of Our Lives | The Common Wanderer", "publish_date": "May 25", "text": "That Time We Got Engaged in Nepal: The Best Day of Our Lives Asia Featured Nepal Personal May 25 Written By The Common Wanderer Exactly one year ago today, we had just made it to the summit of Poon Hill after two great days of trekking in Nepal . It was sunrise on a beautifully clear and crisp morning, and both of us stood in awe as we watched the mountains come alive with colour all around us. And if that wasn’t magical enough, it was also the time that Mark chose to get down on one knee and pop the question! It’s hard to believe that it’s actually been that long already (what is it they say about time flying while you’re having fun?!) — and even more so that we’ve never actually shared the full story of what went down here on our blog! We always meant to fill you guys in properly, but the general chaos of life just always seemed to get in the way. Now that these weird times have given us a chance to slow down, the first anniversary of that special day has crept up on us, and we’re starting to get our act together with wedding planning, we figured there was no better time to finally share that story. So without further ado… this is the tale of how we got engaged on a mountain in Nepal! // BUT LET’S GO BACK TO THE START… The beginning of our love story is actually less romance and instead, a little bit of chaos and unpredictability. We met more than 10 years ago now, at a pregnancy and babies expo (yes, it still makes us laugh too!) in our hometown, Melbourne. Mark was working at the Nintendo stand designed to keep bored dads occupied which happened to be set up right next to where I stood, handing out flyers for my friend’s photography company next door. We got chatting, and ended up talking for hours about anything and everything. But if you thought that a lifelong love was born amongst the chaos of pregnancy hormones, crying babies, and stroller test-drives, well, you’d definitely be wrong. See for a range of reasons, the timing just wasn’t right back then. Though we often found ourselves gravitating towards the other and knew deep down there might be something kind of special there, we simply never quite found ourselves on the same page at the same time. Over the next three years, we became close friends instead - though don’t be fooled, it did get a little messy at times! Then, on a balmy summer evening 7 years ago, we finally got our sh*t together and decided to make a go of things for real - and we’ve basically been inseparable ever since! That summer evening led to our first weekend away, to the Grampians about 3 hours from Melbourne (our fave place in Aus!). That first weekend away led to our first overseas trip together, to Tanzania in 2014, and that first trip together led to us moving in together, planning our big round-the-world trip together, and eventually, throwing caution to the wind and leaving our jobs and Aussie lives behind to travel long-term . Since then, we’ve spent a year backpacking around Asia , Europe and Africa , we’ve found homes in London and Budapest, we’ve built an online business together, explored and eaten our way through more than 45 countries together, and enjoyed doing it all side-by-side. But as the years wore on and our adventures multiplied, there was still something we hadn’t done yet… which brings us to: // MARK’S BIG PLAN… After 18 months away from Australia , we returned for a three month visit to see family and friends in November 2018. After the obligatory tears and hugs from family, the first thing my mum and sister asked me was, “have you thought about getting engaged?!”. I had, obviously, many times over the last four years - it was clear from very early on that Mim was the ‘one’ (she laughs at my bad jokes, which is reason enough!). But whether it was fear, laziness, or timing, I’d never got around to organising a ring and planning a proposal. Being semi-nomadic over that time, it had also been nigh on impossible to organise one, especially considering we spend literally 24 hours a day, 7 days a week together. So after two or so months of being back in Australia, and with Mim and I living on opposite sides of the city (with family), my mum asked the question again. “Shit, I reallllly have to do this asap”, I thought. So, after trawling Pinterest and Instagram with my sister, and talking about all things diamonds and white gold with mum, I visited a local jeweller and designed a ring from scratch, using some heirloom diamonds passed down through my family. I was super worried Mim might not like the design, but when I saw the ring for the first time I nearly cried… it was perfect! The next step was to work out when to propose. We’d been in discussions with a travel brand to head back to Nepal in May, so with it being both our favourite country in the world, I knew I wanted to propose there. The problem was, the trip to Nepal wasn’t confirmed until April, and we were due to spend six weeks in Bali, and then travel by train through India for a month prior to then. How the hell was i going to keep this ring safe, and safely hidden from Mim’s prying eyes!? I devised a plan to store the ring in my camera bag, wrapped in bubble wrap inside a lens case. It was the best solution I could think of; the bag never left my sight, and I manage all the camera gear, so the likelihood of Mim discovering the ring was slim. Fast forward to Bali, where I safely hid the ring inside our camera insert in our Villa, and then to India, where I basically lived with my camera bag on in 40+ degree temperatures to keep it safe (yep, I even slept with it on overnight trains!). They were three nerve-wrecking months to say the least, and something i don’t recommend to anyone! Somehow, when we arrived in Nepal, I’d managed to keep the ring safe and sound, and Mim hadn’t discovered it. I knew I wanted to propose overlooking the Himalaya mountains, so during our short stay in Kathmandu, I organised a three-day hike to Poon Hill/Ghorepani . I knew sunrise was magical from there, and it would be the perfect place for our magical moment. We packed light, but I insisted of taking the whole camera bag. Mim couldn’t understand why I would carry a 15kg camera bag the whole way when we could’ve easily reduced the size, but I needed the ring and the security the bag provided. The trek itself was amazing. Over the two day hike to Ghorepani, we talked about how perfect this was, and how lucky we were to be back in one of our favourite countries in the World. It felt like we’d returned home, hiking through the magical forests in the foothills of the Himalayas, overlooking snow-capped peaks towering in the distance. Regardless of what happened next, it was a dream trip that would stay in the memory bank forever. // HOW IT HAPPENED | MARK’S SIDE To experience sunrise from Poon Hill, you need to wake up at 3am and start hiking to the summit. It’s a pretty easy hike, but in the early hours, in the freezing cold, and over 3,500m altitude, it makes it a hard slog. We made it, just in time to enjoy the magical sunrise experience overlooking the Annapurna ranges. We took the obligatory snaps, and just enjoyed the moment for what it was - a seminal travel moment. At this point I knew it was going to happen, and started getting a few butterflies in my stomach. I started scouting areas to propose, away from the crowds where we could enjoy the moment ourselves. Of course, I needed an excuse for all my running around, which was that I was “looking for somewhere to set up the tripod to take a photo together”. We rarely take photos (we’re trying to get better at this!), so it was a plausible excuse and Mim totally bought it. I found the perfect spot, and started setting up the tripod, asking Mim to stand in position to test the frames. In the meantime, i was in the camera bag, sneakily pulling the ring out of its box for the first time in 3 months. I popped it in my jacket pocket, and ran to Mim to test a few photos together. As I ran back to check if the photos looked good, I popped the ring into my hand, set up a time-lapse at 1 sec intervals and ran back to Mim to take a few more photos. It. was. happening. I was super nervous at this point, and it all felt so surreal (it still does to this day). I looked at Mim, dropped to one knee, and proceeded to ask her to marry me. Halfway through, at the point where I told her I loved her, i burst into tears. I was a bumbling mess but she knew what was up and said YES. It’s funny - if you look at the time-lapse you can see me look away, which was my attempt to compose myself. It’s also funny to see the point where Mim realises what was going on, and breaking down herself. It really was the most magical experience we could’ve ever asked for in the most magical country on earth. // HOW IT HAPPENED | MIM’S SIDE The sky was still inky when we rose from our warm beds and raced to the window of our mountain teahouse to check the weather. Last night, the skies had been ominously grey and foggy, but the clouds had parted as we slept, and treated us to a clear and crisp morning. The waning moon and stars still twinkled over the Himalayan mountains surrounding us, and the whole scene was breathtakingly perfect. Pre-dawn mountain mornings like these are always our favourite; stars above, the unrivalled quiet stillness of a brand new day, and the heightened anticipation of knowing that the goal you’ve been pushing towards for days is finally within reach. In hindsight, it’s probably a good thing that I had no idea what was in store for us, considering I was already jumping out of my skin to get to the summit. Hopping from foot to foot, we laced our boots and raced downstairs, ready for our final 45-minute hike from the town of Ghorepani to the summit. We started off quietly, focused on making out the shape of the path in front of us in the half-light. It’s steep, and about halfway through we crossed the 3,000m mark: the magic point at which you tend to feel the altitude. Long-time readers might remember that I don’t do too well with altitude (I actually got pulmonary oedema on Kilimanjaro and had to turn back), and at this point I started to slow down a little as breathing became thicker and the burn in my legs more intense. As we slowly wove higher, the world around us started to wake. First, the light grew stronger until there was no need for headlamps, then a pinky glow began to creep across the sky. Worried we might miss the sunrise entirely, Mark ran ahead a little with his camera bag - and I wondered, for the umpteenth time on this trek, why he’d insisted on bringing such a heavy camera bag with him…! When we all finally reached the crest, we were greeted by the most stunning sight imaginable: the mountains of Dhaulagiri, Nilgiri, Machhapuchhare, Annapurna II, and Lamjung laid out right before us, illuminated by a glorious golden sunrise. Somewhere nearby, a fellow hiker had somehow carried his guitar up with him, and serenaded us all now with some acoustic faves (Hallelujah and Ed Sheeran classics, of course!). Overwhelmed at having spent the last few days in beautiful natural surroundings in my favourite country with my best friend and now being treated to the most perfect sunrise and atmosphere, I was already fighting back happy tears as I took it all in. Eventually, Mark convinced me that we should try and take some couples photos together — something we’re terrible at remembering to do, but trying to get better at! — so we found a quiet corner with prayer flags fluttering and set up the tripod. As I stood waiting, I had NO idea what was brewing, and as Mark spent the next 10 minutes running between the tripod and where we were standing, checking ‘test’ shots and asking me to move a few steps this way or that, I tried to keep my patience in check. Little did I know that this was all part of his plan to distract me! Eventually, he set the camera on timelapse and ran back to where I was, taking a few shots side-by-side before all of a sudden, he’d dropped to one knee and was holding out the most beautiful ring (which, I would learn a few hours later, Mark had designed himself using family heirloom diamonds, something that means more to me than I can say). Let’s just say if I’d been close to tears already, now there was well and truly a flood as the surprise and happiness took over, and it’s all such a blur that all I really remember is nodding my head furiously and saying yes! It makes us laugh so much now, watching the time-lapse back and seeing my goofy, totally unaware smile in the seconds before it all went down, and then all the emotion that followed for us both. A few hikers around us had clued onto what happened, and came over to wish us well. Being so far from our families, we often miss out on celebrating big moments with them, so it was so lovely to be able to share our excitement with others too! Saying yes to my favourite person, during our favourite pastime (hiking) in our favourite country in the world was a dream, and to add it to our collection of incredible experiences we’ve had in Nepal is just so special. It honestly still makes me just as giddy and emotional when I think of it now, even a whole year later! If you haven’t yet, check out our post on Instagram, including a little GIF timelapse which shows our magical moment! View this post on Instagram HE ASKED… SHE SAID YES! 💍 ↠ A few days ago, during sunrise in our favourite country in the world, Mark got down on one knee and well, as you might have guessed… Now we’re ENGAGED 💕! ↠ To say it was unexpected is an understatement; after a 4:30am start and a steep hike to the summit, I thought the highlight of our morning would be sharing a chocolate bar at the top (our mountain tradition!). Little did I know that when Mark set up the tripod in front of these beautiful prayer flags for some ‘coupley shots’, he had a ring hidden in his pocket and a cheeky plan up his sleeve! Swipe across to see how it all went down 😍 ↠ We don’t normally share much in the way of lovey-dovey stuff here, but this really was one of the most beautiful, emotional moments in both our lives. Nepal has such a big piece of our hearts, and we couldn’t be happier to add this memory to our travels here. ↠ It definitely hasn’t sunk in yet, and we’re still giddy with tears and laughter, but we’re so excited for a lifetime of adventures together. 💕 ↠ #IChosetoWander A post shared by MARK + MIM | TRAVEL (@thecommonwanderer) on May 28, 2019 at 6:01am PDT // NOW WHAT? Fast forward a year to today, and we’ve finally been able to celebrate with our family and friends, and after initially feeling a little overwhelmed by the whole wedding planning thing, we’ve locked in our date and our dream venue and are navigating planning our big day in the midst of this weird Covid-19 world. It’s definitely a tricky time to be planning a wedding and isn’t without its stresses — like working in the travel industry, for example, and not knowing how the next 6 or so months will play out for our business or whether our friends and family from overseas will even be able to attend — but despite that, we’re so excited to plan for our dream day and share a big celebration with our nearest and dearest in early 2021!

{"url": "https://www.thecommonwanderer.com/blog/the-last-resort-nepal", "title": "Taking The Plunge At The Last Resort, Nepal | The Common Wanderer", "publish_date": "May 22", "text": "The Time We Jumped 160m Into a Canyon: Adventures at The Last Resort Nepal Asia Nepal May 22 Written By The Common Wanderer One of the most exhilarating experiences in Nepal can be had at The Last Resort, where adrenaline fuelled activities are the name of the game. Read how we faced our fears and jumped 160m into a canyon, and how you can do the same! No one in their right mind would willingly jump off a 161m high suspension bridge into a canyon where the turquoise rapids of a river churned below, would they? Well. That’s exactly what we thought… until we did it for ourselves in Nepal. Located around four hours from Kathmandu on the Friendship highway that connects Nepal with Tibet is The Last Resort , an adventure lovers paradise tucked amongst incredible natural surrounds. It’s home to one of the tallest bungee jumps in the world (161m high), the longest canyon swing in the world, and endless adrenalin-seeking exploits (did someone mention whitewater rafting, too?), coupled with a unique glamping experience and peaceful natural surroundings. It’s definitely one of the most fun places to visit in Nepal! In this guide, we cover everything from our own tandem rope swing experience to how to get there, where to book, essential info, and our personal tips for the best Last Resort Nepal adventure, ever! THE LAST RESORT: NEPAL’S EPIC ADVENTURE-LOVER’S PARADISE! // OUR TANDEM ROPE SWING EXPERIENCE Now, let it be known that I am not the kind of girl who goes bungee jumping or leaping out of planes. I do love an outdoor adventure, but definitely the types that keep both of my feet on solid ground. But somehow, in between proposing on our Poon Hill trek earlier that week and the two of us standing, knees-trembling, on the Last Resort’s suspension bridge, Mark managed to talk me into doing a tandem rope swing over the Bhote Koshi river. Unsure what a tandem rope swing is? Think of an upright bungee jump with the harness around your middle instead of your feet, strapped awkwardly with one arm around your loved one (or, after this, disliked one), and jumping into a canyon. Look, it’s been a running joke ever since we did our jump that Mark took advantage of my newly-blissed out engaged state while he claims it was about trust exercises and cementing the official start of our adventure-filled life together. Either way, somehow we found ourselves harnessed in and gripping the sides of a breezy suspension bridge with white knuckles, making idle chit-chat while trying to divert our minds away from the obvious impending end of our lives. As the moment drew closer, marked by the dwindling numbers of fellow thrill-seekers on the bridge and too many excited screams to count, we both trembled with fear. Personally, I was preoccupied with searching for any way to escape my harness and run off the bridge to safety, but before I knew it we were being summoned to the ledge to begin our countdown. F*ck. After final safety checks, much-needed words of encouragement from The Last Resort team, and a promise to each other that we would, definitely, 100% both jump at the exact same time, the countdown began. 3, 2, 1…. JUMP. For four (very long) seconds we were in total free fall, the canyon flashing past us quicker than either of us like to remember now. What I do remember, very clearly, is the merciful feeling of tension in the rope as our freefall ended and we were caught in the swing. It felt so outrageously exhilarating we didn’t know how to react when it all came to an end. I’m a crier normally, so you better believe my first instinct was to burst into hysterical tears, laughter, shock, and a looooooot of swearing. Believe me when I say the footage from the GoPro strapped to my hand is verrrrrry entertaining, and definitely NSFW haha. But the verdict? Bloody awesome. To say we pushed through our fears and jumped from one of the world’s highest platforms, in our fave country in the world is a pretty epic feeling. While I’m not sure my nerves could handle another jump, I’m pretty proud of us both and it was TOTALLY worth the pre-jump anxiety! // A LITTLE ABOUT THE LAST RESORT, NEPAL Perched upon a clifftop and surrounded by beautiful forest, Nepal’s Last Resort combines the best of a relaxed and tranquil wellness retreat with pure heart-stopping, adrenaline-pumping adventure. It might sound an odd mix to begin with — after all, bungee jumping doesn’t seem like the most relaxing way to spend your day, right?! — but trust us, it works. The resort itself is super calming, with luxurious safari tents scattered all around the property, the sound of birdsong (and the odd cheer!) all around, and plenty of chill out spaces to grab some food and drinks, read a book, or make new friends in. The kitchen is also brilliant, and buffet meals are included in your day trip or overnight stay, so you won’t need to worry about losing your lunch money during one of the many activities on offer. // LOCATION & HOW TO GET TO THE LAST RESORT NEPAL Located around 100kms drive from Kathmandu (around 4.5 hours), The Last Resort is on the Friendship Highway that connects Nepal with Tibet. The resort isn’t far from the Nepal-Tibet border, and is located in a pretty rural area amongst some beautiful natural surrounds. Getting to The Last Resort is super easy; round-trip shuttle bus transportation from Kathmandu to the resort is actually included in your booking fee. You can organise your ticket at the main office in Thamel (more on that below!). The drive there commences at 6am from Thamel, heading north east out of the city, slowly winding through lush forest and next to the ice-blue Bhote Kosi river, taking in some pretty epic scenery along the way. You’ll also stop for lunch at a pretty river-side restaurant where you can enjoy a tasty buffet lunch for about 200 rupees (we recommend getting it!). When the bus drops you off at the resort, you’ll just need to cross the suspension bridge across the canyon to get to the resort itself. // WHAT ELSE CAN YOU DO AT THE LAST RESORT NEPAL? While the tandem rope swing might not be for everyone, there are a range of awesome adventures and activities offered at The Last Resort, including: Bungee Canyoning Whitewater rafting Solo rope swings Hiking in the surrounding hills and through the local community Relaxing in the sauna! You can also opt to combine any of the above activities to make it a truly action-packed adventure excursion too! // HOW TO BOOK TICKETS FOR THE LAST RESORT NEPAL? Tickets can be booked either online or at The Last Resort’s head office in Mandala street Kathmandu. Prices for activities vary depending on what you choose, and whether you include an overnight night stay too, but expect to pay somewhere around: $90 for a solo canyon swing or whitewater rafting $100 for a solo bungee jump $170 for a tandem swing $150 - 170 for adventure activities and overnight stay * prices quoted in USD // HOW LONG SHOULD YOU SPEND AT THE LAST RESORT? There are day trips, and one or multi-night stays available at the Last Resort. We opted for a day trip to the Last Resort as our time left in Nepal was limited and we wanted to make the most of it. A day trip is a totally feasible option; you’ll depart Kathmandu early in the morning and drive to the resort, stopping for lunch on the way. When you arrive, you’ll have a quick briefing, do your jump/s, then enjoy a buffet lunch before climbing back on board the bus for the trip home again. However, pretty much as soon as we arrived and saw the cute clamping tents and chilled out resort grounds we knew we’d made a bit of an error. We would have loved to stay a little longer and relax in the sauna, soak up the beauty of the area, enjoy a bit of hiking in the hills nearby, and sample some of the other activities (and food!) on offer too. If you have a little more time up your sleeve than we did, we absolutely recommend slowing down and spending a bit longer here! SHOP OUR NEPAL PRESETS! Want to edit your photos like us?

A great decision! Here's everything you need to know before your Annapurna trek, including trekking permits, hiking solo vs in a group, what to pack, when to go, and all the money matters. Hiking Nepal's Annapurna Circuit is one of the most stunningly beautiful, life-changing experiences you can have on your travels, and we're pretty sure that, like us, you'll be absolutely captivated by the area from the very first day. Winding through some of the world's tallest mountains and diverse climatic zones (from tropical to freezing alpine peaks), intensive days spent on your feet, and enjoying the beautiful hospitality of the Nepalese people and their quaint mountain villages: the 16 days you'll spend on the Annapurna Circuit trail are some of the most inspiring and challenging you'll ever encounter, and the arrival back to Pokhara will feel so rewarding. But while it’s super tempting to just book a flight, lace up your hiking boots, and head off into the vast wild, take it from us, wanderers: this is not a simple walk in the park, pun intended! (If you’re looking for a shorter Nepal trek, why not try the Ghorepani Poon Hill trek !). In fact, from preparing for altitude sickness to organising your permits and accommodation, there’s a huge amount of knowledge and planning you need to factor into your pre-trip preparation before you even take your first few steps. For a start, should you go solo or in a group? Will you be able to get snacks en route? and what time of year guarantees the best visibility? From two people who trekked the Annapurna Circuit successfully [book the trek we did with Intrepid Travel here ], but wish they’d had a few more tips up their sleeve while doing so, here’s the essential insider knowledge you need before tackling the long, epic, and beautiful Annapurna Circuit trek for yourself. pssst… want to edit your photos like us?! We’ve just released our brand new collection of presets, including the Nepal Preset Pack specifically designed for your epic Nepal adventures! Check out the full range here now. ANNAPURNA CIRCUIT: 21 ESSENTIAL THINGS TO KNOW BEFORE YOUR NEPAL TREK #1 ANNAPURNA CIRCUIT FACTS | ANNAPURNA AT A GLANCE Before we get into the nitty-gritty of what you need to know about the Annapurna Circuit, here are a few quick facts about the trek for the stat-lovers amongst you! Location | Central Nepal Trek length | Generally 16-20 days Distance | this varies depending on route and whether you take optional side treks, but generally between 170km - 230km Height of Annapurna 1 Main (the highest mountain in the Annapurna Massif) | 8091m Highest point of the trek | Thorong La Pass - 5416m (17,769ft) #2 KNOW WHEN TO TREK THE ANNAPURNA CIRCUIT Hiking in Nepal isn't a 'turn up whenever you like and off you go' kind of affair; seasonal changes (particularly around the monsoon period) have a massive impact on where, how, and what you can hike here. The periods for hiking the Annapurna Circuit are October - early December, and late Feb - April. Go outside of these times and you risk the already tricky Thorong La Pass being totally snowed under (or worse, like what happened during the 2014 Nepal blizzard disaster ) or heavy monsoonal summer rains causing slippery and dangerous conditions. We did our Annapurna Circuit hike with Intrepid at the end of Feb - March and found the weather conditions pretty much perfect; balmy and hot on the lower sections, and crisp with some light snow at the higher levels and the Pass. RECOMMENDATION | Hike the Annapurna Circuit in September, when the skies are clear, the mountains green, and the paths less crowded. #3 THE ANNAPURNA CIRCUIT ITINERARY IS ANTI-CLOCKWISE Since the trail opened in 1977, most trekkers have followed an Annapurna Circuit itinerary that begins in Besishahar and heads in an anti-clockwise direction over the Thorong-La Pass and down into the Jomsom Valley. The main reason for this is acclimatisation. When following the trail anti-clockwise, you have almost 2 whole weeks of acclimatisation (and leg-training!) before you begin the leg-and-lung-breaking final ascent up and over Thorong La (5416m). Going the other way, you’d only have 2 days to acclimatise, as well as tackling some intense 1700m+ incline days along steep, rubbly paths straight up. There’s also very limited access to teahouses in the later days, which means if you do succumb to altitude sickness due to the speed of your climb, you may struggle to find help. Our Annapurna Circuit itinerary with Intrepid looked like this: Day 1 | Kathmandu to Bandipur (by car) Day 2 | Bandipur to Bahundanda via Besishahar (car to Besishahar, then hike to Bahundanda) Day 3 | Bahundandah to Jagat Lamjung (1290m) Day 4 | Jagat Lamjung to Dharapani (1920m) Day 5 | Dharapani to Chame (2630m) Day 6 | Chame to Lower Pisang (3190m) Day 7 | Lower Pisang to Manang (3540m) Day 8 | Acclimatisation day in Manang, including a short hike to higher altitudes - and a movie night at the town’s ‘cinema’! Day 9 | Manang to Yak Kharka (4018m) Day 10 | Yak Kharka to Phedi (4450m) Day 11 | Phedi to Muktinath (3800m) via Thorong La Pass summit (5410m)! Day 12 | Muktinath to Jomsom (2800m) Day 13 | Jomsom to Pokhara (by plane) Day 14 | Free day in Pokhara Day 15 + 16 | Travel back to Kathmandu before the tour ends at midday the following day ( read our Kathmandu guide here )! *Note: since we completed our trek in 2016, this Annapurna Circuit itinerary has changed. Check the new route and book your own trek here #4 YOU CAN HIKE THE ANNAPURNA CIRCUIT WITH A GROUP OR TREK IT SOLO One of the most debated topics when it comes to hiking in Nepal is this: do it with an organised group, or heave on a rucksack full of your stuff and go it alone? Personally, we opted for a group hike on Intrepid's 16-day Annapurna Explorer trek , but we definitely encountered just as many keen hiker going it alone or with a friend. In short, both are absolutely viable options, and each comes with its own merits and disadvantages. HIKING THE ANNAPURNA CIRCUIT WITH A GROUP As two travellers used to independent/solo travel on our own terms, the thought of suddenly being bound by a group and its personalities, plus a set itinerary, and all that comes with these two things were a little daunting. But as it turns out, it absolutely needn't have been. See, when you hike with a group, you’re hiking with a ready-made cheer squad, a team of local guides and porters who a) know the way b) know the signs of altitude sickness (more on that below) and c) can share tidbits of info you'd otherwise miss out on. THE PROS Everything (including teahouse accommodation, permits, etc) is organised for you by the trekking company, you just need to bring snacks and money for meals/tips. Travelling with a reputable travel company also means that your local guides and porters are exceptionally well-versed in local knowledge, first aid, emergency response, etc. A local is always on-hand to share expert knowledge Your team of porters also carry your heavier luggage, so you just need to keep putting one step in front of the other with your daypack on your back. Other people to support and be supported by - which can go a long way when you're all exhausted and out of breath in the final days! THE CONS Can be more expensive than going it alone - but we actually felt it was worth it in this instance! If you're used to independent travel, being bound to someone else's plan (and group personalities) might be a shock, to begin with! HIKING THE ANNAPURNA CIRCUIT SOLO It's definitely not rare to see people self-navigating the Annapurna Circuit by themselves, or hiking together in small groups. Given that the Annapurna trek is also one of Nepal's more popular routes, you'll also bump into a whole lot of other trekkers following a similar path, so you can either buddy up and walk together, or walk amongst the wild solo and regroup for a game of cards later that night. THE PROS Having the freedom to go where you want, when you want, and without having to account for a group Often a lot cheaper than booking through a tour company You get the best of both worlds; solo trekking during the day and a group atmosphere at the teahouses at night THE CONS You're responsible for carrying all your gear, finding accommodation, and organising all your permits, itinerary, etc. You'll need to work out when you'll arrive at a teahouse, and during busy periods, have a backup plan if it's already full. Not having a trained professional around to help you identify potentially dangerous areas, altitude sickness symptoms, or monitor the speed/distance of your hike (it's important to go slow to avoid altitude sickness!). Safety: there are risks in going it alone. While Nepal is a notoriously friendly and welcoming country, there have been instances of solo hikers disappearing on solo treks. While these incidents are few and far between, it's worth bearing in mind. For female hikers, we'd also recommend travelling with a female guide and porter, to avoid any potential harassment incidents.

For the most part , the days are manageable; 5-6hrs and 10-15kms, with plenty of rest, long lunch breaks and a few rest days in between. BUT. Some days on your trek will involve 16 hours at high altitude starting at 4am. Other days can be over 20kms through the \"Nepalese flats\" (aka rolling hills) or in the snow. And then there’s the final day from Muktinath to Jomsom (you can discover all about that yourself!). Our advice is to build your general cardio (the fun stuff!) for at least a month prior to leaving as well as a few consecutive days of long-distance walking. Get your feet used to being in boots day after day. If you want to, try altitude training before you leave. We didn't do this, but we've heard good reports. You’ll be grateful you made the effort when the time comes to lace up those boots up again for the 6th day in a row. see more of nepal | the best things to see and do in kathmandu #6 YOU NEED A TREKKING PERMIT FOR THE ANNAPURNA CIRCUIT No matter when or how you're hiking the Annapurna Circuit, you'll need to organise both a Trekking Information Management System (TIMS) permit, and an Annapurna National Park Permit (sometimes also known as the Annapurna Conservation Area Permit ). As of 2019, the permits should set you back about USD $50 total: the APC Permit is USD $30 / NPR 3,000 per person, while the TIMS Permit is USD $20 / NPR 2,000 per person. These will need to be checked at various checkpoints along the trek. If you're hiking with an organised tour group, your guides will likely manage these for you. If you're hiking by yourself, you'll need to organise these at either the Nepal Tourism office based in Kathmandu , or the Pokhara tourist office before you begin the trek. Make sure you bring a minimum of 4 passport photos for the trekking permit too! #7 IT’S LONG, HARD, AND TOUGH \"It’s always further than it looks. It’s always taller than it looks. And it’s always harder than it looks.\" That’s a quote about the ‘three rules of mountaineering. We’re not really sure who came up with it, but they’re pretty spot on except for one detail: It’s also always completely worth it. We’re going to get all tough love on you here: the Annapurna trek is long, tiring and physically and mentally tough. Depending on which route you take, you’re going to be hiking for 13+ days - probably longer than your first high school romance. Some days will be really physically tough. You’ll be living out of a backpack with a very limited supply of clothing, sleeping on some rock hard beds, eating only carbs (we didn’t say it was all bad!), drinking chlorinated or steri-pen filtered water [2020 update: we now recommend travelling with The Grayl water filtration and purification bottles — our favourite piece of travel kit!], all while having no internet access to check your Facebook (again, not all bad). Sound daunting? Well yeah, maybe it is. But trust us, when you’re standing in awe of the peaks around you, bonding with your group over a cup of hot chocolate, or celebrating crossing the Thorong La Pass these challenges become so insignificant you’ll wonder why they got you down in the first place. #8 THE SCENERY ON THE ANNAPURNA TREK IS INCREDIBLE You know that feeling you get when you spot a hottie across the dancefloor for the first time? The hairs stand up on the back of your neck, your heart pounds like a kick drum, and you have this existential crisis about being so freaking small in this universe and how could all this amazingness actually even exist. Well, this happens Every. Single. Day. in the Annapurna region. With every step , the scenery in front of you changes and the mountains reveal something new; rolling clouds, the breathtaking terrain, the towering mountains or the smiling locals. Need convincing? Here are 30 photos that will inspire you to visit Nepal ! It’s literally the definition of awe-inspiring. Them feels are good for the soul and you’ll leave feeling all giddy about the world. #9 ALTITUDE SICKNESS IS REAL Run the London Marathon? Completed the Hawaiian Ironman? Smash out spin classes four times a week? We commend you for being so awesome in your activewear, but it won’t help you with altitude sickness. Altitude sickness can affect anyone, including the fittest athletes alive (and Sir Edmund Hillary - the first summiteer of Everest!) so make sure you take all the necessary precautions after 3000m. That includes taking Diamox (if you wish, but consult with your doctor), staying hydrated, fuelling up and getting adequate rest. If you feel symptoms, let your guide know and take action. This is serious shit; Miranda developed HAPE, high altitude pulmonary oedema (basically, your blood vessels constrict and leak blood into your lungs, and left untreated, you can drown.. gross, right?) while hiking Mt. Kilimanjaro in Tanzania in Africa , and it was a horrific, long term recovery. We recommend reading up on altitude sickness before you leave . #10 THE ACCOMMODATION ON THE ANNAPURNA CIRCUIT IS MORE THAN DECENT We’ve actually written a full guide to accommodation in Nepal - read it here If you're expecting to stay at the Shangri-La, you'll be disappointed. If you apply a little common sense and realise the Annapurna circuit is pretty remote, you'll be satisfied with the basic accommodation options available. Guesthouses and teahouses are dotted along the whole trek, starting from Besisahar all the way to Jomsom. They're pretty little things made from rock and wood and provide a welcome relief at the end of a long days trekking. Rooms at each teahouse are generally twin-share, with enough space to spread out. As the altitude increases the accommodation becomes more basic, however, the higher you go the happier you'll be with any form of bedding! Each teahouse has a common area which is usually stoked with a fire in the evening. This is where you'll spend most of your time, eating dinner and meeting fellow travellers. Most teahouses make their money from food, so expect to pay slightly more than you would in Kathmandu . We do recommend buying food and drinks at teahouses. Firstly, it will lighten your load, and secondly, it provides much-needed income to what are sometimes fairly poor communities. We have also heard of people bargaining for free accommodation in exchange for paying for food and drink. However, we'd encourage anyone travelling to these areas to be fair, pay for both your accommodation (not more than a few USD) and your food, and help to support communities that desperately rely on tourist dollars for their survival. Most teahouses will have basic amenities, such as showers and toilets. Up until Manang, you'll be able to have hot, solar-powered showers, although be prepared to fight for the first position, as they do run out quickly! You do have to pay for warm showers, but it's definitely worth it. You are also able to charge your electronic devices, although this comes at a small cost. Alternatively, we always travel with our trusty solar charger to keep our devices charged throughout the day (trust us, the sun is out in full force, even when it's cold here!). RELATED | READ OUR ULTIMATE GUIDE TO ACCOMMODATION IN NEPAL nepal post earthquake - what it’s really like to visit #11 TAKE ONLY WHAT YOU NEED There are legends in Nepal; super - strong guys who glide up and down mountains carrying all your stuff on their shoulders and neck. They’re called Porters, and they do this so you can concentrate on accomplishing your goal without the extra baggage. While their feats are super-human, they are in fact quite human, with real human muscles and backs that are equally prone to injury. Help them out here by bringing only what you really need (10kgs or so), so ditch the hair straightener, the three pairs of jeans and the full make-up bag as you won’t need it. We've written a thoroughly in-depth Annapurna Circuit packing list to help you best prepare for this trek. THE ANNAPURNA CIRCUIT BARE ESSENTIALS A pair of good quality waterproof hiking boots spare pair of inside shoes 6 pairs of underwear and four pairs of socks (you can wash them as you go!). Two pairs of hiking pants ( womens prAna pants here ) One pair of shorts Two jumpers ( fleece or woollen) Two thermal tops ( mens here , womens here ) and bottoms One goose-down jacket ( Mens North Face here , womens North Face here ) - you really need this! One Gore Tex jacket One pair of waterproof pants ( mens version here , womens version here ) 1 beanie and 1 buff 1 pair of thick gloves Personal hygiene essentials Medical essentials (like this first aid kit ) The Grayl water purifier and filtration bottle - we use these to drink tap water every place we travel (including India and Nepal!) Your porters (and their spines) will thank you later. everything you need for the annapurna circuit - our annapurna circuit packing list #12 HAVE A WELL-STOCKED MEDICAL KIT FOR THOSE UNEXPECTED MOMENTS Picture this: you're enjoying a tasty dinner in a cute little teahouse with your group after a long day's trekking. The mood is jovial as you wolf down your plate of Dal Bat, and once you're done you play a few rounds of cards before retiring to your cosy room for the evening. Then, at 2am, disaster - in the form of an urgent toilet trip - strikes. Ten minutes later, it strikes again. And again, and again, and again.. Until 7am rolls around and it's almost time to start hiking again, but you basically haven't moved from the toilet floor all night. That's pretty much exactly what happened to Mim in the early days of our Annapurna trek - though we honestly can't work out how on earth she became so ill considering all but one other person escaped without illness, and many people ate Dal Baht that night too! Had it not been for our trusty medical kit full of goodies (aka Immodium, rehydration salts, and water purification tablets to treat water for said rehydration drinks), the chances of her actually being able to leave her bed, let alone walk, would have been pretty slim. Be prepared with a well-stocked medical kit for the unexpected moments, little emergencies, or bloody great big blisters, and you'll never miss a step!

If you’ve made it to Nepal , you’ve probably also got a sturdy pair of hiking boots and a few pairs of thermals stashed in your backpack too -and why wouldn’t you?! This is the mecca of mountain trekking adventures, after all. Long-time readers of this blog will know that having hiked to Everest Base Camp, up and around the Annapurna Circuit , and most recently, scrambled our way up the 3,000 steps of the Poon Hill trek , we are massive advocates for trekking in Nepal. In fact, getting into the mountains is our favourite way to experience this achingly beautiful, incredibly welcoming country. But we’re also massive advocates for sustainable travel , and ensuring that our trekking adventures don’t come at the cost of environmental or cultural damage to the people and places we visit. With talk of overtourism and pollution in Nepal’s mountains dominating the media lately, there’s never been a more important time to talk about how to trek responsibly and ethically in Nepal. The good news is, with a little more awareness of the issues surrounding trekking in Nepal, and a few small adjustments made to the way you trek, you can make a huge difference to the impact you leave behind on the trail. Here’s our complete guide to ethical trekking in Nepal, with everything you need to know to hike sustainably and responsibly in the roof of the world. ETHICAL TREKKING IN NEPAL: EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW - ETHICAL TREKKING IN NEPAL | SHOULD WE STILL BE HIKING IN NEPAL AT ALL? Not too long ago, trekking in Nepal was an active holiday reserved for the most intrepid, thrill-seeking, and hardy of travellers. It was an experience that drew professional mountaineers and experienced alpinists seeking the adventure of a lifetime; those who brought with them an inherent respect and understanding of the towering giants and the nature and communities that surrounded them. These days, the buzz of high-altitude adventures isn’t limited to the professionals. The trekking industry is a billion-dollar business, and each year, tens of thousands of everyday backpackers and outdoor enthusiasts like you and I now stubbornly trudge along the trails. As visitor numbers continually increase, particularly in the Everest and Annapurna regions, so too do the problems that accompany them: littering and pollution , overtourism and crowding on trails , exploitation of local porters and guides , and environmental and cultural degradation. It’s clear that the thrill we’ve all grown to love so much is also fraught with ethical dilemmas. In some cases, it also threatens to destroy the fragile environments and communities that are the reason trekkers are there to begin with. All this begs the question: is it still ethical to trek in Nepal at all? Absolutely yes. Trekking in Nepal boosts the local economy and has helped to raise the standard of living significantly in one of Asia’s poorest nations. Not only should we not boycott the Himalayas altogether, we should be actively encouraging travellers to travel there, and to return over and over again. But we need to be encouraging our fellow travellers to trek in a responsible, respectful manner; one that considers their impact and works to benefit locals, the mountains, and tourists alike. In that way, you can support Nepal’s largest industry (tourism) in a healthy way, while not partaking in its unethical side. - ETHICAL TREKKING IN NEPAL | WHAT TO CONSIDER BEFORE YOUR TREK - - TREK WITH A COMPANY THAT ALIGNS WITH YOUR VALUES Travel is a huge purchase - probably one of the largest you’ll make this year - and finally fulfilling an epic, lifelong dream of trekking in Nepal can often form a pretty large chunk of that purchase. You wouldn’t purchase items from a company that knowingly exploits people or places (we hope!) - so why should your travels be any different?! Do your research and choose a company that reflects your values and beliefs. Some questions to ask yourself are: Does this company care about the communities they visit? Do they empower women and protect children? Do they care about minimising their impact and protecting our planet as they travel too? Do they condone cruel practices like elephant rides? Do they give back to their local communities? And more importantly - do they actually live by these values, or are they just words on a marketing page to them? Large global responsible operators like G Adventures (our personal fave!) use on-ground operators (in this instance, Royal Mountain Trekking ), who are wholly aligned with their overall values, so if you’re considering booking via a global operator, book with them . Alternatively, seek out operators on the ground that are responsible and sustainable in their mindset and actions (we recommend Nepal Wilderness Trekking , and 3Sisters Adventure Trekking ), or hire a trekking guide directly (read how to hire a trekking guide in Nepal ) trek ready? here’s everything you need to know before hiking the annapurna circuit - SUSTAINABLE TREKKING IN NEPAL | ENVIRONMENT - - TREK AT THE TAIL ENDS OF THE SEASON Peak season sees some of Nepal’s more popular trails transform into somewhat of a trekking theme park; full of excited trekkers making their way up the mountains like trails of ants. If you’re willing to gamble a little more with the weather, trekking at the tail end of the season will not only provide you with a more relaxed, enjoyable experience, but also take some of the pressure of over tourism off the trails, both for nature’s and the communities that call it home's sake. We did our Poon Hill trek at the end of May (technically the start of Monsoon), and save for the odd afternoon thunderstorm — which we avoided by getting to our teahouse before they began — the weather was perfect. - OPT TO TREK NEPAL’S LESS POPULAR TRAILS Consider whether it’s ethical to trek some of Nepal’s more popular hiking routes right now, including Everest Base Camp (and beyond) and the Annapurna Circuit . Everest particularly, has been the subject of backlash recently, after a spate of viral images have shown hours-long pedestrian traffic jams and increased deaths near the final summit after a record number of permits were granted and more inexperienced climbers have attempted the feat than ever before. Beyond the highest summits though, Nepal’s two most popular treks suffer the consequences of over tourism in the following ways: Resource consumption | Whether it’s firewood or gas for cooking, or vegetable / edible wildflower cultivation, increased trekker numbers leads to huge strain on the resources required for survival by local communities General environmental degradation and soil erosion | With more trekkers on the hiking trails comes the increased risk of trampled undergrowth, path widening, and soil erosion, which in turn leads to increased risk of landslides, inability to sustain growth, and damaged ecosystems. Environmental contamination | Inadequate recycling in the mountains, trash dumped by trekkers, and faecal contamination all contribute to destruction of the local environment and increased health risks for local communities. Uneven wealth distribution | Obviously those communities who live on the more popular trails benefit more from tourist dollars than those living in other remote communities. Help to distribute wealth equally amongst Nepalese communities by opting for less popular routes too. Opting to trek lesser-known, less-frequented routes (for example, Mohare Danda , Upper Dolpo , Kanchenjunga , and Mardi Himal treks) takes the pressure off the communities and environment around Everest and Annapurna , as well as often providing a richer cultural experience for everyone involved. - BRING A REUSABLE WATER BOTTLE We’ve said it a million times, and we’ll say it again: there is no reason a modern traveller needs to buy bottled water. Ever. Thanks to our trusty water filtration + purification bottles from The Grayl , we haven’t bought a single bottle of water in over 18 months, despite travels through India, Nepal, Sri Lanka, SE Asia and eastern Europe. That’s not virtue signalling, but showing you it’s entirely possible to have your clean water and drink it too, no matter where you are in the world. Plus ACAP (the Annapurna Conservation management body) provide numerous filling stations in the Annapurna region Annapurna Circuit where water bottles can be refilled with UV-treated water. A few other options: Water-To-Go | a reusable water bottle meets powerful filter device (designed by NASA!), which removes 99.9% of all nasties from any water source. Our only complaint is that it tends to leak, often. The Lifestraw | either purchase separately or with a 1l bottle as well. Purification tablets | the original solution. Just drop the tablet into affected water and it’ll be drinkable in around 30-60mins. SteriPen | A compact device which uses ultraviolet light to sterilize water and make it safe for drinking On that topic - if you’re keen for soft drink or juice on the trail, be sure to order the canned version too! why plastic is your problem too: how to use less plastic when travelling - SAY NO TO PLASTIC - AND TAKE ANYTHING YOU FIND OUT WITH YOU Unfortunately, this is a part of the world where proper waste management and plastic recycling programs are still very much a far-off dream. Due to their remoteness and (sometimes) altitude, many of the villages don’t have adequate waste disposal methods, and instead have to make the choice between either burning the rubbish off, or carrying it off the mountain themselves. Add in thousands of trekkers traversing the paths each year and you quickly realise that a lot of waste is either being burnt off each day, left on the trails, or dumped on teahouse operators to deal with. Say no to plastic and opt for the sustainable option when it comes to your snacks, toiletries, etc where possible. What’s more, if do you come across rubbish on your trek, collect it in a tote bag and take it off the trails with you to dispose of properly later. READ | Our ultimate guide on how to reduce your plastic consumption on the road - STAY AT TEAHOUSES THAT USE RENEWABLE (OR CLEANER) ENERGY SOURCES In previous times, it was near impossible to trek in Nepal and not stay in a teahouse that used wood-burning stoves (bad for emissions and also deforestation). Today, plenty of teahouses have invested in solar panels for hot water and electricity, which makes them the perfect option for a more sustainable trekking experience. If that’s not possible, try to stay in teahouses that have either switched to gas, or even better, are using yak dung (a traditional, sustainable way form of energy provision - and a safer way to dispose of Yak poop!). nepal’s prettiest short trek: your ultimate guide to the poon hill trek - STICK TO THE TRAILS AND LEAVE NO TRACE We’re all about taking the path less travelled and exploring pristine wilderness, but trampling a delicate ecosystem is a totally different thing altogether. A single wrong step of the boot on undesignated part of the trail can take the local flora years to regenerate, literally expanding the impact of your footprint long after you’ve gone. Whether you’re hiking, exploring desert landscapes, or wandering along a coastline, stick to the trails and leave no trace behind. - USE A TOILET, NOT THE WILDERNESS Human waste (we’re talking poop, kids!), is a huge issue in the mountains of Nepal, affecting human health and sanitation as well as the biodiversity of the natural surroundings. Where possible, hold onto your ‘business’ until the next teahouse, where you can ‘dispose’ of it accordingly. - USE ECO-FRIENDLY TOILETRIES Switch to plastic-free, biodegradable, chemical-free, eco-friendly toiletries that won’t add to waste on the mountains, including: compostable toothbrushes, switching to solid shampoo, bodywash, and soap bars (we use Lush and Ethique ), use a menstrual cup , toxin-free and biodegradable wipes . READ | Check out our guide to the eco-friendly essentials you need to be able travel sustainably wherever you go pack for the planet: our favourite zero waste travel essentials - EAT DAL BAHT, SAVE THE PLANET ‘Dal bhat power 24 hour’ might be the most common catchphrase you’ll hear on the mountain, due in part to the porters and guides deep love of the tasty lentil curry, and also to its superhuman-power-giving properties for trekking. But there’s also another reason to consume dal bhat at meal times, and it comes down to resource consumption. For one, dal requires less fuel to prepare than other meals, particularly if cooked in a pressure cooker (the most energy-efficient method). If you’re trekking with a group, try and order the same meal, at the same time to cut down on fuel expenditure. Secondly, as Dal Bhat is the staple dish in Nepal, it means that ingredients tend to be more readily available than those required for a western meal, and therefore require less farming or transport to get them to the teahouses in the mountains. - ETHICAL & RESPONSIBLE TREKKING IN NEPAL | PEOPLE, CULTURE, AND COMMUNITIES - - RESPECT YOUR PORTERS AND TREAT THEM FAIRLY They seem superhuman as they glide past you with ease on the trails despite the heavy packs on their backs. They’re the first to cheer you on during a tough day on the mountain, and the first to celebrate with you when you finally make it to the summit. Unfortunately though, while Porters are the backbone of Nepalese trekking, they’re also often the most poorly looked after by the industry they serve. Often subsistence farmers from disadvantaged communities, porters stand a higher chance of being exploited, overworked, underpaid, and poorly treated (think no sleeping bag, lack of food, lack of appropriate medical care). Ensure you opt for a trekking company that complies with the International Porter Association’s guidelines for treatment of porters. When booking your tour or hiring porters, ensure that you choose an operator that provides its porters with the following: Appropriate warm and waterproof clothing, footwear and sun protection Fair and stable basic pay (that doesn’t rely on tips to make it a sustainable income) Proper shelter (including a dedicated bed or sleeping mat, blankets) Adequate medical care and life insurance Weight restrictions (ideally 6-7 kgs per trekker, and no more than 12-14kg per porter). Minimum age requirements plan an epic nepal trip: our ultimate guide to what to see, eat, and do in nepal - DON’T ASK YOUR PORTERS TO CARRY MORE THAN THEY SHOULD We’ve heard of trekkers asking their porters to carry more for an extra fee, and this is super poor practice. While the feats of your porters may seem superhuman — particularly when they glide past you effortlessly on the trail despite carrying huge packs on their backs — they are, in fact quite human, with human muscles and backs that are equally prone to injury. Help them out by only packing your absolute essentials, and sticking to no more than 6-7kg of weight for them to carry. And it should go without saying, but please don’t risk their spines, livelihoods or ability to support their families by asking them to trek overloaded. - DON’T GIVE MONEY OR GIFTS TO KIDS ON YOUR NEPAL TREK We’ve only encountered begging once or twice on Nepalese treks, but if you do yourself, please don’t give them money, candy, pens, or other similar gifts. Even when gift-giving comes from a very kind-hearted place, it actively encourages kids to beg, which in turn keeps them out of school, perpetuates the false belief that all tourists are both safe and wealthy, and encourages organised begging syndicates and human trafficking groups to recruit young, vulnerable children to work for them . - RESPECT THE LOCAL CULTURE For some, Nepal treks are all about personal achievement and self motivation and that’s totally valid, but also keep following in mind: the mountains are where Nepal’s unique cultures and customs can be found, and the Annapurna region is celebrated as one of the most significant cultural and sacred regions of the country. Nepal is generally quite conservative, and it’s important to respect that and behave accordingly. Remove shoes before entering certain temples and holy places and be aware that non-Hindus may not be permitted at some religious sites. Dress modestly, take care not to offend and ask your leader if you are unsure if something is appropriate. Treat locals how you’d wish to be treated as a guest, take your cues from how they behave and dress, and always travel with respect at the heart of your adventures. - LEARN SOME OF THE LOCAL LANGUAGE, AND THE TRADITIONAL NAMES A little bit of language goes a long, long way, no matter where you are in the world. In addition to learning how to say hello ( namaste ) and thank you ( dhanyavad ), also try to learn the traditional names for the mountains in the region you’re trekking in. For example, Everest is the english name for what locals refer to as ‘ Sagarmatha ’ (‘forehead in the sky’) in local Sherpa Language, or Chomolungma (‘Goddess mother of mountains’) in Tibetan language. chaos and colour: explore the best of kathmandu with our travel guide - PAY FAIR PRICES One of the greatest reasons to go hiking in the Himalayas is that it helps to distribute money into rural communities that may otherwise go without. While haggling prices and bargaining in markets is pretty commonplace around the market (and in Nepal), be fair about how low you force vendors to go. Positively support the livelihoods of providers in the mountains by remembering that the goal is to pay the fairest price for everyone involved, not the cheapest. - ALWAYS ASK PERMISSION BEFORE TAKING PHOTOGRAPHS It’s easy to get super snap-happy up in the mountains, considering everywhere you look there’s a stunningly beautiful scene just waiting to be captured. That said, Nepal is culturally quite conservative and religious, so it’s really important to behave respectfully - especially when photographing. Responsible travel photography is all about placing yourself in the subject’s shoes, and thinking about whether it would feel appropriate if someone took a similar photo of you and your family. Would you be okay with it? Is it exploitative in anyway (i.e. is it of people or locals ‘down on their luck’)? Have you sought permission from the subject? Always ask permission before photographing local people, particularly when photographing the older generation). Building rapport with your subject will also lead to a much more beautiful and engaging photo anyway, so everyone wins! Be mindful that in many temples and religious sites, photography is forbidden. If you photograph sadhu (holy men), don’t be surprised if they ask for money after. - DON’T BARTER FOR YOUR ACCOMMODATION We’ve heard of trekkers bargaining for free accommodation on the trail in exchange for paying for their food and drink instead. Please, don’t be those people. As a traveller who can afford to come here and hike through Nepal’s landscapes, you’re already in a position of privilege (even if you’re on a meagre backpacker budget!). Many of the communities here rely upon the income made from hosting accommodation and providing meals to trekkers during the season. Be fair; a few dollars to you means a whole lot more to the communities that rely on them for survival.

Pokhara is the perfect antidote. Here are our favourite things to do in Pokhara, plus advice on where to stay, where to eat, and how to get there. Two things tend to bring travellers to Pokhara: mountain adventures and a chance to unwind. Stretched along the shores of Phewa lake dotted with colourful bobbing paddle boats, this little slice of tranquility is one of our favourite places in Nepal . For those seeking a place to chill (and wash) after three weeks of trekking in the Himalayas, or simply an escape from the chaos of Kathmandu , Nepal’s tranquil lakeside town is the perfect antidote. Each morning on our recent week-long stay, we’d head ‘lakeside’ to walk in the calm morning air, and admire the towering peaks rising amongst the clouds in the distance. These are the 8,000 metre-high snow-capped giants of the Annapurna range, awe-inspiring in their size and stature. On a clear day, they can be seen from everywhere in Pokhara like watchful guardians over the sleepy town. This proximity to the Annapurna circuit has attracted travellers to Pokhara for many years, and while many arrive simply as a stop-off point after epic trekking experiences, they stay for the laidback vibes and burgeoning adventure activity scene. There are a number of epic things to do in Pokhara, especially for those chasing adrenalin, with white water rafting and some of the best paragliding on earth all available here. Somehow, despite the buildings getting taller and the crowds slightly busier in recent years, it still manages to retain an oasis-like feel; carefree and relaxed but with all the familiar traveller essentials. In this post, we’re sharing our favourite things to see and do in Pokhara, as well as our recommendations on where to find the best food and drinks. We’ve also included our tips on where to stay, where to shop, and most importantly where to relax your days away. Psst… Our new presets are here! | We’ve just released our brand new collection of presets, including the Nepal Preset Pack specifically designed for epic Nepal adventures and all its dreamy landscapes! Check out the full range here now. POKHARA HIGHLIGHTS | OUR FAVOURITE THINGS TO DO IN POKHARA HIKING IN AND AROUND POKHARA Hiking in the imposing and impossibly beautiful mountains of the Annapurna Range is, without a doubt, the best thing to do in Pokhara and surrounds. We’ve done many multi-day hikes in Nepal, including the Annapurna Circuit , and we’ve listed two of our favourites from Pokhara below. Before you lace up the boots and take off, check out our complete guide to ethical trekking in Nepal , with everything you need to know to hike sustainably, and leave the mountains pristine for future generations to enjoy too. The following hikes will depend on your available time, budget, and fitness levels: SHORT HIKE (3 DAYS) | POON HILL GHOREPANI TREK If you’ve only got a short time in Nepal but want to both admire the famous Himalayan Range and experience Nepal mountain culture, we recommend the Poon Hill Ghorepani trek . This three-day trek is essentially a microcosm of what a longer Nepalese mountain trek is like. It passes through quaint villages, up many, many stairs, between jungles and over rivers, and before ultimately ending up at altitude (3,200m), with your head amongst the tallest mountains in the world. It really is the perfect way to ease yourself into trekking in Nepal. The views from Poon Hill are some of the best we’ve ever experienced - uninterrupted, panoramic views of some of the largest and most photogenic Himalayan mountains, including Dhaulagiri, Nilgiri, Machhapuchhare, Annapurna II and Lamjung. It also happens to be the spot where the two of us got engaged - so we can definitely vouch for how epic a place it is! What’s more, it’s affordable - treks to Poon Hill Ghorepani start at around USD $150 pp (NPR 10,500). THE DETAILS What | Poon Hill, Nepal Costs | Treks start at USD $150pp (NPR 10,500) Read | Our ultimate guide to the Ghorepani Poon Hill trek, Nepal LONG HIKE | THE ANNAPURNA CIRCUIT Trust us when we say this - the 16 or so days you'll spend hiking the Annapurna Circuit are some of the most inspiring and challenging you'll ever encounter. Trekking between some of the world’s tallest mountains, through diverse climatic zones (from tropics to alpine peaks), passing quaint mountain villages while enjoying the incredible Nepali hospitality is a wonderful travel experience, and one you can only have in Nepal. Nowhere else on earth can you sip chai tea and bask in the sun while admiring 8,000m peaks in all directions. From day seven onwards, it’s tough work - the days are long, the weather changeable, the altitude hard to manage, and the sleeping situation uncomfortable. But reaching the highest point, Thorong La pass, and celebrating with friends, family or strangers, is one of the best feelings in the world. If you’re looking to trek the Annapurna circuit , we recommend booking in advance with a reputable tour company such as G Adventures (check out their 18-day trek here! ) . They take safety seriously, and also respect the environment and local cultures. For more information on the hike, we’ve written the most comprehensive Annapurna Circuit guide on the internet, which you can read here !

Honestly, Phewa Tal and its surrounds wouldn’t look out of place in Zurich, Switzerland , such is its natural beauty, and experiencing it from the water is now, in our opinion, one of the best things to see in Pokhara. We approached one of the lakeside boat counters and organised a skipper, Ishor, who directed us to one of the iconic colourful paddle boats that line the shore. Orange life-jackets on (it’s compulsory!), we slowly made our way towards the lake’s centre, admiring the incredible views in the process; the snow-capped peaks of the Annapurna range on one side, densely forested slopes of Anadu Hill on the other. With incredible peaks as far as the eye can see, the views from Phewa Lake are out of this world. On the lake, the only noise we could hear was the paddle lightly dipping into the water, and bird call in the distance. It was utterly peaceful. We spent the next 30mins taking photos of the stunning surrounds, before slowly making our way back to shore, enjoying the last of the peace and quiet, before stepping to shore and continuing our day. You can book an affordable one hour, two hour or whole day guided paddle boat from one of the many lakeside stalls, or hire a boat and paddle the lake yourself for any agreed time.

Sarangkot is, without a doubt, home to the best views of the Annapurna range without having to hike to Poon Hill or the Annapurna Circuit . From the viewpoint, you’re afforded uninterrupted, panoramic views across a number of the most striking Himalayan peaks, including the imposing Dhaulagiri (8167m), the triangle peak of Machhapuchhare, Annapurna II and Lamjung. The light show here is incredible, as the peaks turn from bright pink, to orange, and finally white. There are a number of chai stalls and tea houses just near the viewpoint which serve fresh tea or coffee, perfect for the post-euphoria come down (are warm up!). To get to Sarangkot viewpoint, you can hire a taxi to take you to the lookout point (NPR 500+), or hire a scooter in Pokhara and follow the signs to Sarangkot.

We thump into the rapids, ice-cold glacial waters snapping us out of our adrenaline fuelled haze. This is pure adventure! We’re on a half-day Upper Seti river white water rafting trip with Paddle Nepal, the leaders in Nepal’s burgeoning rafting scene. Just a short drive from Pokhara, the Upper Seti provides a short but sweet adrenaline-filled rafting experience. Nim, our guide for the day, also happens to be a world champion rafter himself. In fact, he’s just returned from Australia coaching the Nepali national team to a top 10 finish in the world championships. Evidently, we’re in good hands. For 1 1/2 hours we paddle our way down the class III+IV rapids, admiring the Annapurna mountain range in the distance and the peaceful, lush surrounds. Although the rapids are less ferocious than post-monsoon, they’re enough to really kick the heart rate into gear. There’s even time for an impromptu cliff jump, as if another adrenalin-fix is needed. The rafting ends by passing under a suspension bridge covered in colourful prayer flags, before a quick lunch, celebratory Coke, and a 20 minute drive back to Pokhara. It’s the perfect little adrenaline fix, and the half-day trip allows you enough time to experience the rest of Pokhara’s best things to do. For those wanting to do longer rafting expeditions, there are plenty of full day and multi-day options from Pokhara - enquire with the guys from Paddle Nepal. THE DETAILS Where | Paddle Nepal, Pokhara Cost | USD $51 pp, half day trip Further information | Bring adequate footwear for the rafting - either reef shoes or any closed toe shoe you don’t mind getting wet Best time to visit | October to November is the best time to raft, when the rivers are full and clear blue essential reading: how to trek ethically in nepal PARAGLIDE WITH OUTRAGEOUS VIEWS IN POKHARA If you’re going to paraglide anywhere in the world, make Pokhara your place. This is rated as one of the top 5 commercial tandem paragliding locations in the world, with the perfect combination of stable thermal currents, a safe take-off location and landing zone, and epic views. The 30-minute flight provides an initial adrenaline rush before a surprisingly calm glide back to earth. Floating above Phewa Lake and the surrounding mountains (with views to the Annapurna Range in the distance!) is wonderfully picturesque. Paragliding flights launch from Sarangkot, about 30 minutes drive from Pokhara. There are three flight times a day, depending on season and weather - 10:30am, 12pm and 2pm. The best flying time is around midday, when the thermals have become active and the flight the most enjoyable.

What. A. Place. Located in the relaxed northern parts of Lakeside Pokhara, The Juicery is a cafe/bar/yoga studio catering to those who love good food in a very chilled atmosphere. Surrounded by greenery, flowers and fellow travellers bonding over a coffee, we sat down to brunch. Mark ordered Shakshuka (NPR 350) - eggs poached on a slow-cooked tomato stew, while Mim ordered the wild mushroom breakfast (NPR 400) - wild mushrooms and spinach cooked in a herb-lemon dressing and served with poached eggs. Both were served with homemade sourdough. The breakfast tasted as if it was lifted from Melbourne’s premiere cafes, such was the taste and quality of the ingredients. We topped our meals off with an iced coffee (easily the best in Nepal), and watermelon frappe. Our only gripe is that we didn’t venture to The Juicery earlier; in fact we only visited on our final morning! Don’t make the same mistake as us, visit more than once (read: everyday!) on your own visit to Pokhara - it’s definitely one of the best places to eat in Pokhara. THE DETAILS Where | The Juicery, Pokhara Cost | NPR 200 - 400 for brunch, NPR 180 - 260 for a smoothie, NPR 100 - 200 for coffee Opening hours | 7.30am - 7pm, Mon - Sun our guide to nepal’s best short hike | ghorepani poon hill ZEN OUT WITH A YOGA SESSION IN POKHARA We don’t get to practice yoga anywhere near as much as we’d like to these days, so any opportunity we get to practice on the road, we take. To heal our aching muscles post Poon Hill hike , we joined a drop-in class at Lotus Corner, northern lakeside. The hatha class was just what we ordered, a relaxing practice filled with stretching, light poses, and a touch of meditation to finish. Lotus Corner also offers Vinyasa flow classes, and with three different sessions scheduled throughout the day you can seriously get your yoga fix! Although we loved Lotus Corner, Pokhara is filled with many yoga studios offering everything from vinyasa to meditation at affordable rates, so look around for the best options around where you’re staying. THE DETAILS Where | Lotus Corner, Lakeside Cost | NPR 300 per class Class times | 8:30 - 10am, 10:30 - 12pm, 4 - 5:30pm daily Reviews | Read Tripadvisor reviews of Lotus Corner here essential nepal | our top things to see and do in nepal HIKE UP TO THE WORLD PEACE PAGODA (SHANTI STUPA) One of the most popular activities in Pokhara is visiting the World Peace Pagoda on top of Anadu Hill. While we don’t necessarily agree with its popularity (we’d definitely prefer a long, lazy brunch at The Juicery, or morning walk by Phewa!), it’s definitely a place worth visiting for the views alone. Built in 1973 by Japanese monks as a gift to Nepal and a symbol of peace, the Peace Pagoda is an interesting cultural site to visit, and provides some of the best views of the Annapurna Range, Pokhara and Phewa Lake. Although extremely popular with local and foreign tourists, tranquility is important here, so please dress appropriately, respect the rules and enjoy the surrounds quietly. In our opinion, the best way to visit the World Peace Pagoda is by taking a small local boat from ‘lakeside’ across to the small town on the opposite side of the lake. From here, the trail to the summit follows through the beautiful forest and takes around a 45min - 1 hour hike. Alternatively, take a 45min taxi from Pokhara to the summit. As there isn’t much shade to be found on the trail, we’d recommend visiting in the morning to avoid the heat. This is also when the skies are at their clearest and the best views over the Annapurna Range can be seen. Safety note | solo travellers (female, particularly), do be careful if you decide to walk up by yourselves as cases of sexual harassment have been reported in the last few years. THE DETAILS Where | World Peace Pagoda (Shanti Stupa), Pokhara Cost | Entry to Stupa is free NPR 810 - 1210 return boat trip these photos will make you book a flight to nepal immediately! SUNRISE WALK ON THE SHORES OF PHEWA LAKE Pokhara’s iconic lake, Phewa, wouldn’t look out of place in Switzerland such is its natural beauty. And an early morning lakeside walk is one of our favourite things to do in Pokhara. Starting in the south, slowly walk towards the northern shores, enjoying the epic mountainscapes of the Annapurna range as the early morning light illuminates their peaks. At this time of day, there’s a calmness around Pokhara that you won’t find anywhere else in Nepal, so embrace the chill. We recommend stopping at the various lookout points overlooking the colourful paddle boats and forested slopes and watching as the locals fish, hoping to reel in one of the resident catfish. Finish your walk in the north, where arguably the best breakfast and iced coffee in Pokhara (and all of Nepal!) awaits you at The Juicery. If you’re not a morning person, not all is lost! The lake is still a great walk at any time of day. Stop by one of the lakeside juice makers for a healthy pickmeup, or pop into a lakeside bar for a beer or two. There are also a number of Tibetan crafts vendors selling their wares by the lake if you’re keen to grab a bargain. THE DETAILS Where | Phewa Lake, Pokhara RELAX, AND DO GOOD WITH A MASSAGE FROM SEEING HANDS After long days of trekking in the Himalaya, there’s nothing quite as enjoyable as a relaxing massage on your return to Pokhara. While there are a number of massage parlours offering all types of treatments, we highly recommend booking yourself in to Seeing Hands . These guys are a social enterprise providing training and employment in massage therapy for visually impaired people. Mark visited the Seeing Hands guys right after our Annapurna Circuit hike a few years back to relieve all the aches and pains in his lower back and legs. After a quick consultation, he was on the massage bed enjoying a soothing massage. It was as good as he’s ever had, and a nice way to support a local community at the same time. The clinics are open seven days a week, but we recommend booking ahead during the peak season. THE DETAILS Where | Seeing Hands, Pokhara Cost | Massages start from NPR 500 Opening hours | 10am - 5pm Reviews | See what other travellers thought of Seeing Hands on Tripadvisor trekking the annapurna circuit | our top tips! SHOP ‘TILL YOU DROP IN POKHARA If there’s one thing we love doing in Nepal, it’s shopping. There’s just something about the colourful textiles and abundant jewellery that makes it way to easy to spend our hard-earned dollars without regret. Pokhara, especially, has some of the best shopping in Nepal. Take a wander along Lakeside road and you’ll find yourself fawning over an abundance of Tibetan goods, soft textiles and linens, silver jewellery, hiking gear, and fascinating new reads. Some of our favourite shops include; Popular book shop | has all the latest best sellers at a quarter of the usual retail price, as well as travel guides, maps, and notebooks. Zaroo the Great | We want to buy pretty much every single woollen jumper in here. Has a great selection of Cashmere and Pashmina products and decent prices Dressmart | Looking for a bargain, or some of those typical backpacker threads (but actually nice!)? Then shop here Store of Hemp | Selling a variety of hemp based clothes, including modern shirts for the guys, and overalls and dresses for the ladies Tibetan Mini Market | The best place to find Tibetan handicrafts and jewellery, run by the people's cooperative society of Tashi Palkhel (the Tibetan refugee camp just outside of Pokhara) Although the prices may be a little more expensive than those in Thamel/ Kathmandu , we actually found the quality and variety much better in Pokhara. EXPLORE THE CAVE SYSTEMS AROUND POKHARA In the hills surrounding Pokhara are a number of cave systems — some of which are 100’s of years old — that are worth a visit if you have some extra time. The best cave to visit in Pokhara is Gupteshwar Mahadev, lo", "images":

Discover how this group of inspiring Panauti women are tearing down barriers to equality, building businesses, and connecting with global travellers like never before. I’m sitting on a plush red carpet in the living room of a home in Panauti, a rural village in Nepal , squeezing sweetened dough into the shape of a funnel. Rather unsuccessfully. We’re making Yomari, a steamed dessert made during festival times. The dough is a sweetened rice flour carefully kneaded by hand (and a touch of oiled water) into a funnel. Once I’ve managed this, it will have thick condensed milk spooned in before being pinched shut for cooking. It sounds easy, but the whole process is an exercise in concentration. Not enough oiled water and the dough will crack and split (as mine is doing now). Too much oil, and the whole thing deteriorates into a globby mess. Our host mother, Sarina, has an eagle eye hidden under one of the warmest smiles I’ve ever seen, and I’ve already had one attempt knocked back without mercy. “Push. roll. push. roll. No, no squeeze,” she comes over and taps my fingers when I push too hard on the fiddly dough. Slowly, slowly, we work together to knead the dough into something resembling a cone and she nods with approval. Thankfully, despite my own shortcomings, I have a fall guy sitting right next to me: Mark is yet to have any of his approved. By now, Sarina and the rest of my yomari-making mates (including Mark!) are doubled over with laughter, tears streaking down their faces at his feeble attempts. Between the 8 of us in the room, we speak French, Hindi, Nepali, and English - an unlikely combination for a rural town in Nepal . Yet Panauti is no ordinary Nepalese town. kathmandu highlights | our favourite things to see and do in kathmandu Just 32km and two hours drive from Kathmandu , it’s an ancient Newari town rich in culture and said to have been built upon a single rock foundation. This slab has protected its structures from many of Nepal’s largest earthquakes ( we wrote about our time in Nepal post earthquake, which you can read about here! ), including the one that devastated much of the country in 2015. It’s pretty and quaint; red-brick buildings with intricate wood trimmings surrounded by rice terraces carved into the foothills of the Himalayas. More importantly though, it’s also home to the Panauti Community Homestay project , where a group of strong, independent Nepali women are stepping outside their comfort zones, building profitable businesses, and transforming the idea of what a woman in rural Nepal is capable of today. Pre-2013, travellers used to pass through pretty Panauti on day treks, but never slept the night in the town. Recognising the potential of his historic Newari town and the need to create more opportunity for women in his community, one G Adventures local guide approached the town elders and the Planeterra Foundation . read next | our in-depth nepal travel guide The project was launched in 2013 with just 2 women, a number that’s swelled to 20 women and families today. The premise was simple: connect global travellers on homestays with local women and their families. Participants have learnt English, houses have been remodelled and bathrooms westernised for a global visitor. Travellers stay overnight. They learn to cook traditional food, much like I am (unsuccessfully!) right now. They share their cultures, and discover life in a pretty village in rural Nepal . [Note: to experience the Panauti homestay for yourself, book this 7-day G Adventures Local Living Nepal tour ! ] But more than that, the women involved have been empowered to move beyond the home and their family duties, and take a more active role in society. “The premise was simple: connect global travellers on homestays with local women and their families.” visiting nepal? Here are our top nepal travel tips Many of Nepal’s husbands and fathers - including those in Panauti - work long stretches away from the home. Employed overseas in places like Saudi Arabia or Qatar, or taking work as trekking guides, drivers, labourers, or security guards, they’re often gone more than they’re home. The strain on families can be immense and overwhelming, but by opening their homes to travellers, this group of Newari women are stepping outside their comfort zones and taking back control of their financial independence. A family involved in the Panauti project can earn up to USD $400 per month - a very comfortable amount in Nepal . 80% of the income made from homestays like these goes straight to the women in charge. 20% is deposited into a community fund that supports scholarships, sanitation training, and built the community hall a few minutes walk away from where we’re sitting right now. the best of nepal | our favourite things to see and do in nepal Over dinner, Sarina shares that through the project, she’s been able to add another floor to her home - the very one we’re sitting upon now. She, and the other women, are not just contributing to household expenses — something that used to be quite rare in Nepal — but they’re stepping up as powerful leaders within their community, and commanding respect and equality from their communities. As we chat through mouthfuls of food, Sarina’s son arrives home. He’s studying architecture in Kathmandu , and seems totally unperturbed by the fact that 6 strangers are eating dinner in his living room. He speaks in proud, heartwarming tones about the impact of the homestay project on his mother, \"She’s empowered, she’s confident. That’s the power of tourism for Nepal, it’s the best way forward for my country”. In a country where travel is dominated by epic adventures and landscape photography goals, projects like Panauti provide something from travellers that cannot be photographed, only experienced or felt. It’s a chance to enjoy a fun, unique and authentic travel experience, all while empowering a community from within. When the time comes for us to leave, Sarina gives us a hug and says, “I miss you!”. When Mark says he misses her cooking already, she chuckles, “I miss your Yamori!” As our bus pulls away, we wave ‘bye mum, bye dad!’ It may sound facetious given we only spent an afternoon together, but parting really does come with a tinge of sadness. In the space of a few short hours, we’ve felt a true bond with this beautiful family. It’s moments like these, that transcend language and culture that I travel for, and I can already sense that despite 8+ weeks of travel in Nepal across multiple trips, these few hours spent with Sarina will forever be indelibly printed amongst my favourite travel memories here. “ She’s empowered, she’s confident. That’s the power of tourism for Nepal, it’s the best way forward for my country ” - HOW TO ENJOY YOUR OWN PANAUTI HOMESTAY EXPERIENCE To experience the incredible Panauti community for yourself, join G Adventures on their 7-day Nepal Local Living stay in Panauti .

The mountains were so wild and so stark and so very beautiful that I wanted to cry. I breathed in another wonderful moment to keep safe in my heart. - Jane Wilson-Howarth Dal Bhat power, 24 hour. The two of us don't always agree on everything (peppers, for example). But there is one thing we can both wholeheartedly agree on: Nepal is our favourite country in the entire world. Six weeks here on our first trip felt a lifetime too little, yet we trekked the Annapurna Circuit , relaxed in Pokhara , navigated Kathmandu's craziness , and searched for tigers in Chitwan. It was beautiful, adventurous, and undoubtedly epic. Nepal's mountains, jungles, medieval cities, spiritual sites, heavenly food, and super friendly people quickly had us enchanted. We’ve been back since, and even got engaged in 2019 at the Poon Hill summit! But what really makes Nepal so dear to our hearts is the intangible. There's a deep spirituality here. You can feel it the minute you step out into the chaos of Kathmandu , in the prayer flags that flutter messages of peace, in the genuine warmth of the people you encounter. There's a real magic to travelling in Nepal , a kind we're yet to experience anywhere else. Mountains. It's clichéd to talk about Nepal's epic landscapes, but they're reason enough to visit the country. But as if having the heights of Everest wasn't enough, Nepal had to serve up another 7 of the world's 10 tallest mountains and some of the best hiking and mountaineering imaginable. Then, it gifted the world the chilled-out lakeside town of Pokhara (a perfect setting to relax in after your hard mountain trek ), the birthplace of Buddha at Lumbini, the steamy safari plains of Chitwan, the ancient royal cities and warren-like streets of Kathmandu , and warm, welcoming locals. It's almost like it knew exactly what nirvana looked like... In all seriousness though, don't put off your Nepal travels any longer - make this the year you stand on the shoulders of giants, and finally come to understand the meaning of 'Dal Bhat power, 24 hour'.

For Mim, it's a connection with childhood. Her grandmother and mother are both photographers, and some of her earliest memories are watching images appear, like magic, under the red glow of their dark room at home. For Mark, it's a more recent love, just three or four years old. His first tentative steps into photography began as we left Australia , rapidly growing more confident as we travelled for a year with our cameras out every day. For both of us, there’s nothing more magical than being able to freeze our travels in time forever through a lens; the faces found in local markets, an epic mountain landscape, the hilarious travel mishaps that would otherwise fade from memory. Today, we're fortunate to have reached a point where our passion is also our job, which is why we've put together this collection of photography gear guides , tips and hacks , and photo journals to guide you to better photography and inspire you to get out there and shoot more often.

It was our first overseas holiday together, a trip to Tanzania in 2014 (long before the idea for this little internet baby was even conceived) that sparked our love-affair with this wild and diverse continent. Between hikes up Kilimanjaro , safaris on the plains of the Serengeti, and lazy days on the beaches of Zanzibar, we experienced a country so richly diverse , friendly, and beautiful, we knew we had to come back. Since then, we've also enjoyed the world-class wines of South Africa , stood at the edge of Victoria Falls in Zambia, watched gorillas in the steaming jungles of Uganda, canoed through the reeds of the Okavango Delta in Botswana , left footprints on the ancient sands of Sossusvlei , and hung out the back of a beat-up pickup with 20 locals heading to a peaceful mountain plateau in Malawi . To say the rhythm and beauty of this continent has captured our hearts is to put it mildly. If you're looking for life-changing adventure beyond the tried and tested travel routes, this is your place. This is a continent where rhythm rules all. The sound of lions as they prowl the savannah, the thunder of Mosi Oa Tunya (Victoria Falls) , the soft plodding of elephant feet in the plains. The language and music of thousands of cultures coming together, the song ' Kilimanjaro, hakuna matata ' as you stumble into camp after a hard day's trekking. This is still a land of extremes; vibrant cosmopolitan cities exist alongside extreme poverty , unrivalled natural beauty gives way to arid, isolated deserts, and ancient traditions fight for a place alongside new technology. But there’s a cultural richness and beauty here that has to be experienced in order to be truly understood. Plus you haven't lived until you've seen an African sunrise; a great red ball of fire rousing the wilds of the Savannah. Africa Travel Guides.

The most beautiful thing in Cambodia isn't the country - it's the Cambodian people. - Rithy Panh Cambodia: the Kingdom of wonder We already knew Cambodia was awesome: the ancient temples , the relaxing white sand beaches of paradise islands , and bustling cities. But the Cambodia we love best was found far beyond its sparkling main attractions, amongst the fields of rice, the stilted houses, lush junglescapes, and in the hardworking and earnest faces of people always ready with a smile. It was found in the three days we trekked deep into the jungle of the Cardamom Mountains to sleep in hammocks under the stars and listen to inspiring tales of a community’s renewed commitment to conservation. In the castaway-esque treehouse without running water or electricity on the yet unspoiled island of Koh Ta Kiev . In the ability of the Cambodian people to remain so welcoming despite suffering great tragedy at the hands of a brutal regime. To us, the true charm of the Kingdom of Wonder is its myriad of incredible travel experiences and moments of profound beauty and humanity. It won't take you long to fall in love with Cambodia. Pristine white beaches, lush jungles, ancient cities , and bustling cosmopolitan hubs, it's a country that seems to have everything going for it. In many ways, it's the Thailand of 25 years ago - tourism is growing rapidly, yet it still retains that old school southeast Asian charm, beautiful landscapes, friendly locals, and wonderful food. But Cambodia is also still recovering from a dark and painful recent past, and travels here will take you on a journey through extreme contrasts. From the heavenly beauty of Angkor Wat to the depths of despair at Phnom Penh's Killing Fields and S21 , and the heartwarming progress of community-based ecotourism in the Cardamom Mountains to the relaxing waters of white-sand island beaches ; you'll be moved, inspired, and warmly welcomed every step of the way.

Going to Southeast Asia for the first time and tasting that spectrum of flavours - that certainly changed my whole palate, the kind of foods I crave. A lot of the dishes I used to love became boring to me. - Anthony Bourdain There’s nowhere quite like Asia. The starting point of our year-long trip in 2015: Singapore , followed by months backpacking through the southeast. For 3 months, we ate our fill in Singapore's Hawker Halls , rediscovered our sense of zen in the land of a million elephants (and temples!): Laos . We did jungle hikes at a community-based ecotourism project in Cambodia , watched sunrise over ancient temples in Bagan, swam in Sri Lanka ’s tropical oceans, and devoured many tasty street food meals in Bangkok . And while we have long loved Asia for its vibrance and beauty, this time around we also fell in love with it as the home of our favourite country in the world: Nepal . Amongst the hiking trails , chaos of Kathmandu , and people of Nepal , we found our own slice of travel Nirvana — we even got engaged there in 2019! The world's largest continent in more ways than one: most populous, most culturally diverse, and home to the world's largest mountain ranges … Asia doesn't do anything by halves. Crossing from one side of the continent to the other, you'll discover ancient gilded temples , lush tropical paradise, soaring snow-capped mountains , the peace of monks in prayer, and the honking chaos of colourful neon cities. Then there are the flavours. The sizzle and clink of a Kothu Roti being prepared in Sri Lanka , the fragrance of a steaming Pad Thai from a local street food cart in Bangkok, the mouth-watering mix of spices in an Indian curry. It's vibrant, spiritual, and at times dizzying; a rare mix of adventure and spirituality that offers something for every traveller. Our latest Travel Guides from Asia.

I love a sunburnt country, a land of sweeping plains, Of ragged mountain ranges, of drought and flooding rains. I love her far horizons, I love her jewel-sea, Her beauty and her terror – The wide brown land for me! - Dorothea Mackellar Fall in love with the wide brown land. Though we've spent little time here in the last five years, this is the country that raised us on a healthy diet of glorious sunshine, playing outdoors, and Vegemite sandwiches. Though it’s terribly cliched, the longer we spend away, the luckier we feel to call this burnt land home. From the food and wine ( Melbourne coffee, we miss you dearly) and thriving sports and culture scenes right through to the breathtaking landscapes and beautiful weather, growing up here has basically spoiled us for life. No matter where our travels take us, Australia will always be home. Beaches. BBQs. Beer: Any backpacker will tell you that these are the things that sum up Aus perfectly, and while they do make up a great portion of life in the 'Lucky Country', there's so much more to it than an endless summer party. Let's start with the landscapes. Rugged and wild, from the scorching red deserts of the Outback to the picturesque turquoise coastlines , Australia is both extreme and stunningly beautiful. There are the ancient rock formations of Uluru and the Kimberleys, thick forests that stretch from Far North Queensland to Tasmania, the technicolour of aquatic reefs. The rich spiritual stories and culture of our Indigenous traditional owners, the world's oldest civilisation, grew from these lands too. Then, there are cosmopolitan cities with quirky laneways to explore, world-class food and wine scenes, epic road trip opportunities , and a laid-back, jovial culture that's totally infectious. If you're all about the best things in life - the great outdoors, great weather, epic landscapes, and a bloody good meal - this is the place for you. Prepare to fall in love with the wide brown land.

Here's our 'how-to' guide to backpacking Venice on a budget. Venice; arguably the most beautiful city on the planet; home to canals, gondolas, bridges, and famous sights such as the Grand Canal, the Rialto Bridge, the Palace of the Doge and the Piazza San Marco. Alas,great beauty attracts great costs, and Venice is also arguably one of the most expensive cities on this pale blue dot. But while it might seem impossible, backpacking Venice without going bankrupt is possible - you’ve just gotta know how. That's why we put together our 'how to' guide to backpacking Venice. SURVIVING VENICE ON A BACKPACKER BUDGET WHAT TO BUDGET FOR VENICE We're not going to lie, if you're backpacking Venice on a budget, things will be a little tough. Given the nature of the city, things are simply more expensive. If you are backpacking Venice on a budget and follow our suggestions in this travel guide, you shouldn't need to spend any more than €50 – 70 a day. HOW LONG TO STAY IN VENICE Venice is wondrous, and if we're honest, we could have stayed there forever. Unfortunately for us, and for you, reality exists! So how long should you stay in Venice? Overall, we suggest spending at least two days in Venice . This will give you a day to slowly meander, a day to really sightsee and a day to visit the outer lying islands such as Burano & Murano. WHERE TO STAY IN VENICE Yeah, we get it; the whole point of visiting Venice is to stay in a palatial room on the grand canal. But that backpacker travel budget probably means you’re not even going to get a room in the janitor's closet. Fortunately, there’s a solution! If you're backpacking Venice, we recommend staying back on the mainland in the suburb of Mestre or on one of the outer lying islands such as Guidecca. While you're not right in the thick of it, you still can be in and out of town in 10 minutes, and there are a huge array of hotels, hostels, and pensions for about a quarter of the price of anything you’ll find on the main island. There are also supermarkets where you purchase so you’ll be making friends with the locals in no time. #1 HOSTELS & HOTELS While there are a number of hostels in Venice, there are not many that fit within the backpacker budget. The best hostel option is: Generator Venice | Fondamenta della Croce, 84-86, Giudecca, Venezia They're pretty much the best hostel chain in Europe and their dorm is relatively cheap (if you're keen on a dorm). For hotels, you're going to push that budget of yours right to the edge, but if you're after a little more privacy, it might be worth the extra euros. Check out Venice's best (and cheapest) hotel options here . #2 AIRBNB As always, AirBnb is a brilliant alternative to hotel or hostel accommodation. You can find a range of Airbnb rentals outside the city centre for as low as €35 for a private room if you book early. Prices are usually much higher during peak season. To get £25 off your stay with AirBnB, click here and use our coupon code . #3 CAMPING Another alternative to keep those costs down is camping. While no campsites exist on the main islands, there are a few on the outer lying islands that offer. There are few campsites outside of Venice that offer beds in a two person tent for around €10+ per person. If there are two or more people, a more cost effective option is a private bungalow/chalet for around €25 . The two best camping options are: Camping Serenissima Via Padana 334/a, SR 11 (Padua-Venice) Cheap, includes kitchen facilities and is a short 20min shuttle to the centre of Venice. Camping Rialto Via Orlanda,16 Campalto, Campalto Cheap and only 10 minutes from Venice by bus. This property doesn't have a kitchen. WHERE TO EAT AND DRINK IN VENICE Along the well-worn paths of Venice lie many restaurants that do the Italian culinary industry no favours. Terrible, overpriced food is plated up, the service is second-rate, and the cover charge just to sit at their sticky tables is so outrageous you’ll throw up your half-cooked lasagne in no time. If you're backpacking Venice and want great grub for cheap, go where the locals go. BACARI A Bacari is a cheap, hole-in-the-wall style establishment, of which many are dotted all around Venice - generally away from the tourist hubs. Here they serve cicchetti , colourful small plates of food (basically the Venetian version of Tapas) often accompanied by red or white wine, or an Aperol Spritz. Best of all, each plate costs around €1.50. You'll find the cheapest and best Bacari around the Cannaregio and Ghetto area. RESTAURANTS We all know that Italy = Eataly, so you'll be spoilt for choice in Venice, IF you know where to look. We found the best and cheapest restaurants were off the beaten track, in areas such as Cannaregio and Castello. If you’re on the mainland (Mestre, Marghera), follow the locals to their favourite haunt. Meals there will set you back around €10pp which no doubt fits within a tight budget. Be wary of any restaurants on the well worn tourist path - they tend to be pretty average and overpriced. PICNICS If you're sick of eating in restaurants every night, grab some bread, cheese and prosciutto from a mercato or supermarket and enjoy an impromptu picnic as you people watch along the canals. We recommend doing this around Mercato di Rialto . The views are stunning and the food readily available. OTHER TIPS | FOOD & DRINK IN VENICE #1 Be aware, sitting down in a restaurant will add a service fee of around 10-15% per person. Grab your food to go and sit in one of the many squares or piers. #2 You can buy fruit off street vendors which look delicious, but can be quite expensive. It's best to grab your fruit at a supermarket before you go into town. #3 If you love your coffee, get used to one a day, at most. Coffee is expensive here (and read tip #1 - never sit down!). #4 Gelato is bountiful and beautiful in Venice. Never pay over the odds though - €1.50 for a scoop or move on. #5 Always ask for tap water at restaurants #6 At most supermarkets and mercato, food is sold by weight. The more you eat, the more you pay! WHAT TO SEE AND DO IN VENICE THE BEST CHEAP/FREE ATTRACTIONS IN VENICE Any backpacker will tell you that the key to surviving a tight budget is sourcing all the free/discounted things you can - particularly when in Europe! Thankfully, the travel gods smile at travellers in Venice, and there are a few things here that are free, which means your hard-earned will stretch that little bit further. Ironically, the ridiculously beautiful 1100 year old architectural wonder nicknamed the ‘church of gold, the Basilica di san Marco is one of those places. Marvel at the gold mosaic, precious marbles, and stonework arches safe in the knowledge that you can still afford that extra plate of pasta tonight. Between April and October you can also get a free guided tour by the diocese discussing all things mosaics and theology. When you're done, stroll around the magnificent Piazza San Marco . One of the Grand Canal's most iconic landmarks, the Basilica di Santa Maria della Salute , also has free entry. This Roman Catholic church was commissioned by Venice’s plague survivors to offer their thanks for salvation and is now said to have healing properties. Free AND healthy... these Venetians really know what they’re doing! The stunning Rialto bridge is also free to enjoy, although you'll need to fight through the hoards of tourists and pesky touts to take in its real beauty. OR you could do what we did and get up early, and have it to yourself. If art or photography are your jam there are also a bunch of admission-free galleries like Galleria Traghetto and Galleria La Salizada , which showcase contemporary Italian art and photography. Or you could... WANDER THE STREETS If you want to see a lot of Venice as cheaply as possible, lace up those sneakers! It’s a surprisingly large city to explore on foot and in its winding alleyways you will absolutely, definitely get horribly lost at some point. But the secret is, that’s actually the best way to see Venice. All it takes is a couple of wrong turns and you’re off the tourist path and in amongst beautiful canals and bridges, historical sites, hidden squares and bustling neighbourhood markets, all for the cost of walking off your lunch! We totally recommend hitting up the Jewish Quarter, Castello and Dorsoduro districts . Free walking tours do exist in Venice and are a cheaper alternative to your usual tours. Note, free does not actually mean free - be prepared to 'tip' your guide anywhere between €5 & €10. MUST SEE VENICE ATTRACTIONS (IF YOU WANT TO BREAK THE BANK) #1 GONDOLA RIDE A must do or lame? Romantic or kitschy? Either way, gondola rides have lured tourist for generations. Only you can decide whether €80 for a 40min gondola ride through the canals is worth it, however all we can say on the subject is Venice is more amazing from the water. We'll leave it at that! #2 THE PALAZZA DUCALE Formerly the Doge's residence and the seat of Venetian government, today, it's a museum complete with stunning artworks. The very symbol of Venice and a masterpiece of Gothic architecture, The Palazza Ducale is worth the €19 admission fee. HOW TO GET AROUND IN VENICE OUTSIDE OF VENICE If you’re backpacking Venice and planning on staying in Mestre or the outer suburbs, there are many transport options to get you into town, including train and bus services. TRAIN Trains from Mestre takes about 10 minutes, and they leave every 15 minutes, and they cost about €1.50 - less than a beer!You can catch almost every train through Mestre to Venice but just be sure to double check before jumping on a train. The first services leave around 5am so early birds can still catch the morning sunrise and if you decide to head home a little later in the evening, the last train leaves just after midnight. BUS Buses from outer suburbs into Venice leave regularly and cost around €1.50 if pre-purchased. Otherwise, if you purchase on the spot, they cost €3. The first bus service leaves around 5am and the service concludes just after midnight. AROUND VENICE WALK See above! Walking really is the best way to get around Venice; get lost, roam free and best of all don't spend any money. TRAGHETTI Probably the cheapest alternative to walking, Traghetti rides cost around €2 for non residents. They operate the Grand Canal route and stop at seven points between the railway station and St. Mark's square. VAPORETTO Venice's main public transport is the Vaporetto. Rides cost €7 one way (valid for 75 mins) or a 24hr pass costs €20 . In our opinion, unless you're heading out to the outer islands, just use those legs and walk. keep reading | 7 reasons to visit italy TRAVEL INSURANCE | STAY SAFE IN ITALY Whatever you do, don’t travel through Italy without travel insurance , even if you’re the most experienced traveller.

Cobblestones, cafes, culture - Europe really holds a special allure for these two Aussies. Can you blame us? For a start, Europe is about as far from our homeland as one can get, and what could be more iconic to an Aussie traveller than the sparkling Eiffel Tower , the romance of Venice , the white-washed rustic villages of the Med , or the soaring heights of the Alps ?! But the beauty of this continent is its diversity, and while everyone else is visiting the major tourism players, there are so many more delights to discover if you're willing to take a step off the well-beaten tourist trails . Like Bucharest, the grungy capital of Romania (touted to be the 'new Berlin') , or the rugged arctic tundras of Swedish Lapland . We've now called this part of the world home for nearly 4 years (first in London, and now Budapest ), and the magic of being able to jump on a short train ride to a place where we don't speak the language, can’t read anything on the menu and can lose ourselves in a maze of cobblestoned streets and thousand-year-old history definitely hasn't worn thin yet.
